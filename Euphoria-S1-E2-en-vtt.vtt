00:00:00.795 --> 00:00:02.989
You're about to start
a brand-new chapter.

2
00:00:03.236 --> 00:00:05.058
You think 'cause I went to rehab
I stayed clean?

3
00:00:07.128 --> 00:00:09.693
Some new girl I think
you're gonna be friends with.

4
00:00:09.776 --> 00:00:11.267
-I'm Rue.
-Jules.

5
00:00:11.805 --> 00:00:12.756
Hi.

6
00:00:13.708 --> 00:00:14.909
You're fucking crazy.

7
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.391
I'm just trying to get back
at my ex-boyfriend.

8
00:00:18.757 --> 00:00:20.537
You can stay
in a town like this,

9
00:00:21.075 --> 00:00:22.192
end up like me,

10
00:00:22.275 --> 00:00:24.220
living your life out
in motel rooms.

11
00:00:25.214 --> 00:00:26.497
Why don't you take your top off?

12
00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:30.594
I know what you want.

13
00:00:30.677 --> 00:00:32.456
This bitch is gonna get
fucked up!

14
00:00:32.954 --> 00:00:34.941
You wanna fucking hurt me?

15
00:00:36.927 --> 00:00:38.499
Where you headed to?

16
00:00:39.948 --> 00:00:40.816
Home.

17
00:00:41.023 --> 00:00:43.590
And then...
things got weird.

18
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.074

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.591
<i>Sometimes, when I get really high,</i>
<i>I kind of think I'm psychic.</i>

20
00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:16.389
<i>When Nate Jacobs was 11 years old,</i>

21
00:01:16.556 --> 00:01:19.517
<i>he found his dad's porn collection.</i>

22
00:01:19.684 --> 00:01:22.061
<i>His dad, Cal, was obsessive.</i>

23
00:01:22.228 --> 00:01:25.356
<i>His mom always said</i>
<i>that's who he got it from.</i>

24
00:01:25.523 --> 00:01:27.775
<i>Then he quickly realized</i>
<i>that the colored cases</i>

25
00:01:27.942 --> 00:01:30.152
<i>and placement were no accident.</i>

26
00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:36.408
<i>It was an elaborate code,</i>
<i>that no one </i>fucked <i>with his shit.</i>

27
00:01:36.575 --> 00:01:39.745
<i>I have a very pretty dick.</i>
<i>Do you want to see it?</i>

28
00:01:39.911 --> 00:01:43.290
<i>What do you like to be called?</i>
<i>Mister? Master?</i>

29
00:01:43.456 --> 00:01:48.878
<i>-Daddy?</i>
<i>-For you? You can call me "Daddy."</i>

30
00:01:49.045 --> 00:01:53.841
<i>Open wider. Wider.</i>
<i>More like that.</i>

31
00:01:55.843 --> 00:01:57.553
<i>- Yeah!</i>
<i>- Good?</i>

32
00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.263
<i>Yes, Daddy. I'll be good.</i>

33
00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.265
<i>Every video was basically the same.</i>

34
00:02:01.432 --> 00:02:03.892
<i>Oh, you are all woman, aren't you?</i>

35
00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:05.936
<i>- Mostly.</i>
<i>- Mostly.</i>

36
00:02:06.103 --> 00:02:08.105
<i>They'd drink, make small talk...</i>

37
00:02:08.271 --> 00:02:11.775
<i>Oh, don't make me come.</i>
<i>I... I want to wait for that.</i>

38
00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:14.986
...a<i>nd then his dad would</i>
fuck the shit out of some...

39
00:02:15.153 --> 00:02:18.614
<i>Fucking whore.</i>
<i>Fucking slut.</i>

40
00:02:56.233 --> 00:02:58.610
I want to talk to you.

41
00:03:04.157 --> 00:03:06.618
You're a strong man, Nathaniel.

42
00:03:08.453 --> 00:03:11.372
I knew it from the moment
you were born.

43
00:03:13.082 --> 00:03:16.711
You have an... iron will...

44
00:03:18.004 --> 00:03:20.715
...drive, determination.

45
00:03:20.881 --> 00:03:23.759
I've always admired that in you.

46
00:03:23.926 --> 00:03:26.512
Because some day, it will
lead you to greatness.

47
00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.689
But no one in this world
will ever root for you.

48
00:03:37.856 --> 00:03:41.484
They'll see what I see
and they'll despise you for it.

49
00:03:41.651 --> 00:03:45.613
Sometimes you'll know,
and sometimes you won't.

50
00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.283
But the farther you go,
the sharper their blade.

51
00:03:50.451 --> 00:03:53.328
Just don't ever
give them an opening.

52
00:04:01.127 --> 00:04:06.049
<i>By 12, he had adopted a rigid</i>
<i>diet and workout schedule.</i>

53
00:04:06.216 --> 00:04:11.846
<i>Within a year, his body fat</i>
<i>dropped from 23% to 6%.</i>

54
00:04:35.368 --> 00:04:37.787
Ready? All right!

55
00:04:37.954 --> 00:04:41.082
<i>He joined the football team</i>
<i>as a freshman and quickly excelled.</i>

56
00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:45.127
Red... Red, 32, hut!

57
00:04:45.294 --> 00:04:47.004
<i>By the year's end,</i>

58
00:04:47.171 --> 00:04:50.674
<i>he was not only the starting</i>
<i>quarterback, but the team captain.</i>

59
00:04:50.841 --> 00:04:52.718
Keep it together, Nate.
Stay focused.

60
00:04:52.884 --> 00:04:55.220
All right, let's fucking go!

61
00:05:08.232 --> 00:05:10.985
<i>He loved the crowds,</i>

62
00:05:11.152 --> 00:05:15.197
<i>the </i>cheers, the feeling <i>of winning.</i>

63
00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.328
<i>But he hated being</i>
<i>in the locker room.</i>

64
00:05:21.495 --> 00:05:25.624
<i>He hated how casual how his teammates</i>
were <i>about being naked...</i>

65
00:05:27.917 --> 00:05:31.129
<i>...how they'd talk to him</i>
<i>with their dicks hanging out.</i>

66
00:05:31.296 --> 00:05:34.257
<i>He made a concerted effort</i>
<i>to always </i>maintain eye contact

67
00:05:34.424 --> 00:05:36.092
<i>during these exchanges.</i>

68
00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:37.677
<i>Every now and then, he'd forget,</i>

69
00:05:37.843 --> 00:05:40.012
<i>and accidentally catch</i>
<i>a glimpse of someone's penis.</i>

70
00:05:56.569 --> 00:05:59.155
<i>His older brother Aaron</i>
<i>was a fuck-up.</i>

71
00:05:59.322 --> 00:06:02.533
<i>He could tell his dad didn't like Aaron,</i>
<i>didn't think he had guts or brains</i>

72
00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:05.411
<i>or half a fucking clue</i>
<i>and Nate agreed.</i>

73
00:06:07.079 --> 00:06:11.208
<i>He didn't talk to his dad that much,</i>
<i>but they didn't need to.</i>

74
00:06:11.375 --> 00:06:13.710
<i>They had a good relationship.</i>

75
00:06:13.877 --> 00:06:17.714
<i>He didn't like his mother either.</i>
<i>She was weak, and a pushover.</i>

76
00:06:17.881 --> 00:06:20.508
<i>Plus, she didn't</i>
<i>take care of herself.</i>

77
00:06:20.675 --> 00:06:22.344
<i>He made a long mental checklist</i>

78
00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:25.346
<i>of the things he liked</i>
<i>and disliked about women.</i>

79
00:06:25.513 --> 00:06:28.641
<i>He liked tennis skirts</i>
<i>and jean cut-offs,</i>

80
00:06:28.808 --> 00:06:31.018
<i>but not the kind so short</i>
<i>you could see the pockets.</i>

81
00:06:31.185 --> 00:06:33.521
<i>He liked ballet flats and heels.</i>

82
00:06:33.688 --> 00:06:35.481
<i>He hated sneakers and dress shoes.</i>

83
00:06:35.648 --> 00:06:39.234
<i>But was fine with sandals as long as</i>
they were worn <i>with a fresh pedicure.</i>

84
00:06:39.401 --> 00:06:41.945
<i>He liked thigh gaps, hated cankles.</i>

85
00:06:42.112 --> 00:06:45.741
<i>He liked tan lines, long necks,</i>
<i>slender shoulders.</i>

86
00:06:45.907 --> 00:06:49.619
<i>He liked good posture</i>
<i>and fruit-scented body mist.</i>

87
00:06:49.786 --> 00:06:52.747
<i>He liked full lips, and small noses.</i>

88
00:06:52.914 --> 00:06:54.874
<i>He liked chokers, but the lacy ones</i>

89
00:06:55.041 --> 00:06:57.543
<i>with flower cutouts</i>
<i>or delicate patterns.</i>

90
00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:02.590
<i>He hated girls who sat like boys,</i>
<i>talked like boys, acted like boys.</i>

91
00:07:02.757 --> 00:07:07.845
<i>But there was nothing on planet Earth</i>
<i>he hated more than body hair.</i>

92
00:07:09.555 --> 00:07:13.100
<i>That's one of the first things</i>
<i>he noticed about Maddy.</i>

93
00:07:13.266 --> 00:07:15.018
<i>She was basically hairless.</i>

94
00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:22.233
<i>He'd walk her home</i>
<i>from school every day.</i>

95
00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:26.195
<i>Made him feel good to know</i>
that he was there <i>to protect her.</i>

96
00:07:26.362 --> 00:07:29.448
<i>He knew the world was full of</i>
men <i>who wanted to hurt Maddy.</i>

97
00:07:29.615 --> 00:07:34.078
<i>Men who hang out the windows of</i> their
cars <i>and scream obscenities at her.</i>

98
00:07:34.244 --> 00:07:37.372
<i>College guys who wouldn't</i>
<i>think twice about drugging her.</i>

99
00:07:37.539 --> 00:07:40.959
<i>Lonely guys who'd spot her</i>
<i>at a mall.</i>

100
00:07:41.126 --> 00:07:46.131
<i>Men who'd rape her, torture her,</i>
sell her <i>into sexual slavery.</i>

101
00:07:46.297 --> 00:07:48.883
<i>He didn't even</i>
<i>like to think about it.</i>

102
00:07:50.468 --> 00:07:55.389
<i>He did, however, like to thing about</i>
<i>the things </i>he'd do <i>to protect her.</i>

103
00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.978
If anyone ever tried to
hurt you, I'd kill them.

104
00:08:01.145 --> 00:08:04.064
You're, like, the sweetest guy ever.

105
00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:09.528
<i>He also liked</i>
<i>that Maddy was a virgin,</i>

106
00:08:09.694 --> 00:08:12.656
<i>that no guy had ever</i>
<i>put his penis in her.</i>

107
00:08:12.822 --> 00:08:16.659
-You're a virgin?
-Yeah.

108
00:08:16.826 --> 00:08:19.954
-Like, fully?
-Yeah.

109
00:08:20.121 --> 00:08:21.873
What about like...

110
00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:27.211
-Have you ever been fingered?
-Only my own.

111
00:08:30.631 --> 00:08:34.843
<i>He sometimes imagined marrying</i>
<i>Maddy and starting a family.</i>

112
00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:37.304
<i>He knew he didn't want boys, though.</i>

113
00:08:37.471 --> 00:08:40.098
<i>But he also didn't like</i>
<i>the idea of having girls.</i>

114
00:08:41.766 --> 00:08:44.811
<i>Plus, Maddy could be a real bitch.</i>

115
00:08:44.978 --> 00:08:49.065
<i>Like that night at McKay's party,</i>
<i>something just flipped.</i>

116
00:08:49.232 --> 00:08:52.568
<i>And he knew he had anger issues,</i>
<i>but, I mean, so did every guy.</i>

117
00:08:55.905 --> 00:08:59.867
<i>It's not like that was anything in</i>
his life <i>he could trace it back to.</i>

118
00:09:00.033 --> 00:09:04.538
<i>It was just... who he was,</i>
<i>and who he'd always be.</i>

119
00:09:14.881 --> 00:09:16.841
What are you doing?

120
00:09:17.008 --> 00:09:20.803
Nothing, I just came to...
came to say goodnight.

121
00:09:25.599 --> 00:09:29.895
- Good night.
- Good night.

122
00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:06.554
<i>It was the first day of school,</i>
<i>and my heart was racing.</i>

123
00:10:11.976 --> 00:10:16.021
<i>I made a new best friend and for the</i>
first time <i>since getting out of rehab,</i>

124
00:10:16.188 --> 00:10:19.358
<i>I was feeling good about the world.</i>

125
00:10:20.734 --> 00:10:23.070
<i>I've got an idea.</i>

126
00:10:24.238 --> 00:10:28.950
- What?
- Wanna get high?

127
00:10:29.117 --> 00:10:33.121
- What is it?
- No idea.

128
00:10:33.288 --> 00:10:37.500
- Didn't you just get out of rehab?
- Yeah.

129
00:10:38.835 --> 00:10:42.046
- Should I be concerned?
- Maybe.

130
00:10:42.213 --> 00:10:47.468
- I feel like this isn't a good idea.
- I kinda disagree.

131
00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:54.224
Rue.

132
00:11:03.316 --> 00:11:06.611
Do you feel anything?

133
00:11:11.657 --> 00:11:15.953
Do you feel anything?

134
00:11:17.329 --> 00:11:20.582
Rue, what's wrong?

135
00:11:20.749 --> 00:11:24.002
Just so happy.

136
00:11:31.217 --> 00:11:33.344
<i>I know you're</i>
<i>not allowed to say it...</i>

137
00:11:37.014 --> 00:11:39.350
<i>...but drugs are kind of cool.</i>

138
00:11:42.895 --> 00:11:46.273
<i>I mean, they're cool</i>
<i>before they wreck your skin...</i>

139
00:11:47.482 --> 00:11:49.484
<i>- ...and your life...</i>

140
00:11:49.651 --> 00:11:52.195
Can you grab me a towel?

141
00:11:52.362 --> 00:11:54.489
<i>...and your family.</i>

142
00:11:54.656 --> 00:11:57.992
Gia, I need you to grab me a towel.

143
00:11:58.159 --> 00:12:00.661
I found her down.
I gave her one dose of Narcan...

144
00:12:00.828 --> 00:12:03.873
<i>That's when they get uncool.</i>

145
00:12:08.252 --> 00:12:11.338
<i>It's actually a very</i>
<i>narrow window of cool.</i>

146
00:12:20.639 --> 00:12:23.016
I'll wait with you
until your mother comes home.

147
00:12:23.183 --> 00:12:25.059
You want to watch some TV?

148
00:12:25.226 --> 00:12:29.105
<i>And once you pass through</i>
<i>that window of cool...</i>

149
00:12:29.272 --> 00:12:34.360
This is embarrassing.
I feel like everyone knows.

150
00:12:35.611 --> 00:12:40.032
Rue, I don't want to turn
this into a competition,

151
00:12:40.199 --> 00:12:45.037
but, like, I win.
For, like, a multitude of reasons.

152
00:12:45.203 --> 00:12:47.789
I just... I don't want to deal with
all the fucking questions.

153
00:12:47.956 --> 00:12:50.291
I still win.

154
00:12:56.130 --> 00:12:58.716
Wait, you're alive?

155
00:12:58.883 --> 00:13:01.594
Like, what the fuck?

156
00:13:03.179 --> 00:13:05.931
Oh, shit, that's the girl who tried
to commit suicide at McKay's.

157
00:13:06.098 --> 00:13:08.058
- Wait, what?
- Oh, yeah. I forgot.

158
00:13:08.225 --> 00:13:11.144
You guys both was fuckin'.

159
00:13:11.311 --> 00:13:13.730
Why does everybody
think we fucked?

160
00:13:16.191 --> 00:13:18.526
<i>Now Maddy knew</i>
<i>she had an optics issue,</i>

161
00:13:18.693 --> 00:13:21.529
<i>along with a mountain</i>
<i>of evidence against her.</i>

162
00:13:21.696 --> 00:13:24.866
<i>So, last night,</i>
<i>while texting with Nate...</i>

163
00:13:26.867 --> 00:13:29.036
<i>...Maddy had an idea.</i>

164
00:13:36.877 --> 00:13:41.214
- Alcohol is not good for me.
- So you did fuck him.

165
00:13:41.381 --> 00:13:44.884
- Honestly, I think I blacked out.
For real?

166
00:13:45.051 --> 00:13:46.928
Maddy!

167
00:13:47.095 --> 00:13:49.889
- Hey, you.
- Oh, look! It's our new sexpert!

168
00:13:50.056 --> 00:13:52.683
-Congratulations, bitch!
-Welcome to the club!

169
00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:55.102
<i>Now, when Kat told BB</i>
<i>she lost her virginity</i>

170
00:13:55.269 --> 00:13:58.022
<i>to some dude whose name</i>
<i>she didn't remember, she knew</i>

171
00:13:58.189 --> 00:14:01.859
<i>she'll tell Maddy and Cassie, and</i>
the rest <i>of the fucking planet Earth.</i>

172
00:14:02.026 --> 00:14:04.194
<i>But that was kind of the point.</i>

173
00:14:04.361 --> 00:14:07.823
<i>She was just relived</i>
<i>that it was no longer a thing.</i>

174
00:14:24.839 --> 00:14:28.467
Hey, I'm Ethan.

175
00:14:28.634 --> 00:14:32.221
- Please don't be a mass shooter.
- What?

176
00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:36.349
Sorry, it's just, like, the
first thing that came to mind.

177
00:14:36.516 --> 00:14:41.021
Oh, my God.
Am I giving off shooter vibes?

178
00:14:41.187 --> 00:14:42.647
-Yeah.
-Really?

179
00:14:42.814 --> 00:14:45.316
- Eh, you know.
- Shit.

180
00:14:45.483 --> 00:14:49.153
Look, I don't know. What's
your Reddit username?

181
00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:51.697
Um, it's IncelUprising.

182
00:14:54.033 --> 00:14:56.952
I'm joking. A joke.

183
00:15:01.331 --> 00:15:04.793
- I'm Kat.
- Uh, I'm Ethan.

184
00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:07.379
Yeah, you said that.

185
00:15:07.545 --> 00:15:12.258
Okay, listen up, everybody.
Welcome to Biology 301.

186
00:15:12.425 --> 00:15:15.720
So, let's start with
a little improvisation.

187
00:15:15.887 --> 00:15:17.555
I'd like each of you to get up

188
00:15:17.722 --> 00:15:21.058
and tell us a five-minute story
about your summer.

189
00:15:22.351 --> 00:15:25.604
Looks like we have
our first volunteer: Rue.

190
00:15:25.771 --> 00:15:27.397
Please don't do this to me.

191
00:15:27.564 --> 00:15:31.026
Come on, everyone. Let's give
her a little encouragement.

192
00:15:54.756 --> 00:15:56.133
A memory?

193
00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:59.594
Anything that had
an impact on you this summer.

194
00:16:02.931 --> 00:16:06.226
I don't... I don't...
I can't think of...

195
00:16:08.686 --> 00:16:13.691
Just... relax your body.
Release the tension.

196
00:16:15.109 --> 00:16:18.112
And just breathe.

197
00:16:18.279 --> 00:16:22.282
We recommend taking her directly
to the rehabilitation center.

198
00:16:28.371 --> 00:16:32.709
- So this... this summer?
- Yes.

199
00:16:53.979 --> 00:16:56.856
Let's go.

200
00:17:00.985 --> 00:17:06.157
I'm having trouble, like, remembering
something, you know.

201
00:17:06.324 --> 00:17:10.119
Just tell us a specific memory.

202
00:17:10.286 --> 00:17:12.746
Uh, okay. Uh...

203
00:17:12.913 --> 00:17:16.458
I was, um, with my mom,
and my, uh, my little sister,

204
00:17:16.625 --> 00:17:20.170
and we were, uh,
listening to this... this song.

205
00:17:36.018 --> 00:17:38.437
I know you know this song.

206
00:18:35.699 --> 00:18:39.078
Are you doing drugs in my house?
Are you doing drugs in my house?

207
00:18:39.244 --> 00:18:41.121
What are you doing?

208
00:18:45.625 --> 00:18:47.711
I'm not joking!

209
00:18:47.877 --> 00:18:50.171
I need to...
I need to go!

210
00:18:50.338 --> 00:18:52.966
-Dad's so fucking proud, Mom.
-Oh, really?

211
00:18:53.132 --> 00:18:56.094
Dad's so fucking proud.

212
00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:57.720
Get off of me!

213
00:18:57.887 --> 00:18:59.597
- I don't give...
- Get off of me!

214
00:18:59.764 --> 00:19:04.143
Back the fuck up. Back the fuck up and
let me out of this fucking house.

215
00:20:07.869 --> 00:20:11.289
I'm sorry, but I...
I can't think of anything, so...

216
00:20:13.875 --> 00:20:15.960
Just...

217
00:20:17.879 --> 00:20:21.632
I'm, uh... I'm done. I can't.

218
00:20:21.799 --> 00:20:24.343
- Do I have to do this?
- She's a mess, dude.

219
00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:29.056
- Honestly, I bet it's brain damage.
- You're being fucking rude.

220
00:20:57.541 --> 00:20:59.001
Fuck.

221
00:21:03.964 --> 00:21:06.925
Rue, it's me.

222
00:21:08.843 --> 00:21:13.514
- Are you okay?
-You are so fucking stupid, Lexi.

223
00:21:13.681 --> 00:21:15.600
-Why?
-'Cause I already flushed everything

224
00:21:15.766 --> 00:21:17.184
down the fucking toilet.

225
00:21:17.351 --> 00:21:18.728
Well, I just came to check on you.

226
00:21:18.894 --> 00:21:22.690
I don't want you to fucking check on me,
whether I'm fine or I'm not fine.

227
00:21:22.856 --> 00:21:26.026
What difference are you going to make?
Are you going to give me a life advice?

228
00:21:26.193 --> 00:21:30.113
-You gonna fucking help me?
-Well, you're one of my best friends.

229
00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:33.783
Give me a fucking break. 'Cause we
went to fucking pre-school together?

230
00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:36.786
That does not make us
best fucking friends.

231
00:21:38.121 --> 00:21:40.373
You say all this,
but what happens in three days

232
00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:44.126
when you knock on my door asking
me to piss in some Tylenol bottle?

233
00:21:44.293 --> 00:21:46.003
What, you're gonna say the opposite?

234
00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:49.006
How we've known each other since
pre-school and we're best friends?

235
00:21:49.173 --> 00:21:52.343
It's like you have
a split personality disorder.

236
00:21:52.509 --> 00:21:55.179
Sorry if I miss the old you.

237
00:22:01.893 --> 00:22:07.523
I slept like shit, too.
Yeah, I miss you.

238
00:23:19.216 --> 00:23:23.929
-My name is Ali, and I'm an addict.
-Hi, Ali.

239
00:23:24.095 --> 00:23:26.222
Actually, an addict
is a nice word for it.

240
00:23:26.389 --> 00:23:29.601
I was a stone-cold crackhead.

241
00:23:29.767 --> 00:23:33.980
I was also a firefighter, so I thought,
the two might cancel each other out.

242
00:23:34.147 --> 00:23:38.692
As long as I saved lives, I was well
within my right to destroy my own.

243
00:23:40.236 --> 00:23:43.155
The problem was, I was...

244
00:23:43.322 --> 00:23:47.117
I was also a father,
to two young girls.

245
00:23:48.618 --> 00:23:51.913
My girls live in Texas.

246
00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:57.752
I speak to them whenever I can.
Drugs can take away a lot.

247
00:24:00.088 --> 00:24:03.466
<i>The first time</i>
<i>I tried Oxycontin, I was 13.</i>

248
00:24:05.509 --> 00:24:07.595
What do these feel like?

249
00:24:10.514 --> 00:24:13.016
They're the absolute worst.

250
00:24:15.018 --> 00:24:17.104
<i>I used to take care</i>
<i>of my dad after school</i>

251
00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:20.690
<i>had to take a second</i>
job <i>to cover the medical bills.</i>

252
00:24:24.569 --> 00:24:27.447
<i>A state-issued nurse would come</i>
<i>by every day for two hours,</i>

253
00:24:27.613 --> 00:24:31.701
<i>and she'd, legit, just play</i>
<i>Candy Crush on her phone.</i>

254
00:24:32.993 --> 00:24:38.040
<i>But, anyway, the point is,</i>
<i>he had, like, a bunch of pills.</i>

255
00:25:21.122 --> 00:25:24.500
<i>He was too out of it</i>
<i>to know I was high.</i>

256
00:25:24.667 --> 00:25:27.878
And I always have
the best time with you.

257
00:25:28.045 --> 00:25:30.297
Me, too.

258
00:25:31.423 --> 00:25:33.634
Do you mind?!

259
00:25:41.099 --> 00:25:43.977
Hey. Uh, I'm gonna need you
to do me a big favor.

260
00:25:44.144 --> 00:25:46.271
You see, there are
a bunch of these meetings

261
00:25:46.438 --> 00:25:51.400
that I was supposed to attend
that I didn't actually attend, so...

262
00:25:51.567 --> 00:25:55.154
I'm gonna need you
to backdate this slip.

263
00:25:58.657 --> 00:26:02.161
Yeah. Ethically, that's a line
I will not cross.

264
00:26:08.083 --> 00:26:12.420
What if I, uh... suck your dick?

265
00:26:18.593 --> 00:26:21.554
Like, in my car?

266
00:26:21.721 --> 00:26:25.015
I'm 17, you fucking creep.
Sign the slip.

267
00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:36.860
-Pleasure doing business with you.
-Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

268
00:26:46.869 --> 00:26:48.746
Rue.

269
00:26:50.623 --> 00:26:54.627
-Love you.
-Love you, too.

270
00:27:28.742 --> 00:27:31.078
Um, I'm gonna be right back.

271
00:27:33.997 --> 00:27:36.416
Fuck, yeah.

272
00:27:37.709 --> 00:27:39.460
Fucking slut.

273
00:27:42.797 --> 00:27:46.842
Oh, fuck! Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck...

274
00:27:58.979 --> 00:28:03.817
<i>She never admitted it,</i>
<i>and no one could ever prove it,</i>

275
00:28:03.983 --> 00:28:05.902
<i>but we all knew it was her.</i>

276
00:28:27.672 --> 00:28:32.469
<i>Or, I don't know, I guess for Kat,</i>
<i>it probably felt like we all knew.</i>

277
00:28:34.178 --> 00:28:36.848
<i>That's the weird thing</i>
<i>about the Internet.</i>

278
00:28:37.014 --> 00:28:39.600
<i>Ten people can feel like</i>
<i>the whole world.</i>

279
00:28:44.313 --> 00:28:48.650
Meet me in the cafeteria in
five minutes. We need to talk.

280
00:28:48.817 --> 00:28:50.819
Why?

281
00:28:52.279 --> 00:28:55.866
Listen, Kat. I didn't do anything.
I told Roy not to post it.

282
00:28:56.032 --> 00:29:00.078
It doesn't matter, okay? He's still
sending it to people and saying it's me.

283
00:29:00.245 --> 00:29:02.247
Look, I don't want
my life to be ruined,

284
00:29:02.413 --> 00:29:04.874
and I'm sure you don't want to
end up on a sex offender list.

285
00:29:05.041 --> 00:29:09.628
-Kat, you know I'm not a sex offender.
-It's child pornography, you dumb fuck.

286
00:29:09.795 --> 00:29:13.173
But we're all under 18. Children
can't make child pornography.

287
00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:17.136
-Troy, google it.
-I'm not googling child pornography.

288
00:29:17.302 --> 00:29:21.223
You know what? Fuck it. Fuck
it, I'm going to the police.

289
00:29:21.390 --> 00:29:25.518
All right! Okay. Okay, okay, I get it.
What do you need?

290
00:29:25.685 --> 00:29:28.188
First, for you to delete the video off
your phone...

291
00:29:28.354 --> 00:29:31.065
-...and whoever's phone you sent it to.
-That is done.

292
00:29:31.232 --> 00:29:35.152
And for you to tell Wes to tell
everybody that it's not me. Okay?

293
00:29:35.319 --> 00:29:39.198
Okay. Done.
Anything else?

294
00:29:40.574 --> 00:29:42.034
Actually, yeah.

295
00:29:42.201 --> 00:29:45.495
<i>So even though Roy and Troy</i>
<i>tried to put an end to it,</i>

296
00:29:45.662 --> 00:29:48.999
Kat? Nah.
It was some other bitch.

297
00:29:49.166 --> 00:29:52.419
Oh, dude. What the fuck?
I thought you said it was Kat.

298
00:29:52.585 --> 00:29:54.963
I did, but, I mixed that bitch up.

299
00:29:55.130 --> 00:29:57.924
<i>By the end of the week...</i>

300
00:30:10.853 --> 00:30:13.564
<i>Katherine Hernandez, please report</i>
<i>to the principal's office.</i>

301
00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:16.441
<i>Katherine Hernandez</i>
<i>to the principal's office.</i>

302
00:30:16.608 --> 00:30:18.944
<i>I heard a very disturbing rumor.</i>

303
00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:22.322
- About what?
- There is a recording of you

304
00:30:22.489 --> 00:30:26.200
engaged in... sexual activity.

305
00:30:26.367 --> 00:30:31.789
Or something to that effect, that is
being shared amongst the students.

306
00:30:31.956 --> 00:30:34.959
Is this about that video of that
girl getting banged from behind?

307
00:30:35.125 --> 00:30:38.670
Because no, it's not me, but...
just out of sheer curiosity,

308
00:30:38.837 --> 00:30:41.381
what could have possibly
led you to believe that is was?

309
00:30:41.548 --> 00:30:45.218
I just want to be clear that I haven't
personally seen the video...

310
00:30:45.385 --> 00:30:48.013
It is because the girl in the
video is fat, Principal Hayes?

311
00:30:48.179 --> 00:30:50.890
I'm not jumping
to conclusions, Katherine...

312
00:30:51.057 --> 00:30:53.726
I'd just appreciate it if everyone would
stop talking to me like it was,

313
00:30:53.893 --> 00:30:57.730
because, frankly, it's... offensive.

314
00:30:57.897 --> 00:30:59.982
You know, it's one thing for my
classmates to body shame me,

315
00:31:00.149 --> 00:31:05.571
but for you, Principal Hayes
that's just... a whole nother thing.

316
00:31:05.738 --> 00:31:09.283
It's degrading.
It's... discriminatory.

317
00:31:09.449 --> 00:31:12.119
And it just goes to show
how insidious, and...

318
00:31:12.285 --> 00:31:15.997
systemic body terrorism
truly is in this country.

319
00:31:16.164 --> 00:31:18.541
From my own principal.

320
00:31:18.708 --> 00:31:23.296
Well, I'm... I'm...
I... I can't apologize enough.

321
00:31:23.463 --> 00:31:25.756
And I give you my word,

322
00:31:25.923 --> 00:31:30.094
I will do everything in my power
to put an end to this rumor.

323
00:31:31.136 --> 00:31:33.097
Thank you, Principal Hayes.

324
00:31:33.263 --> 00:31:35.265
<i>And so on the same way</i>
<i>that mass shootings,</i>

325
00:31:35.432 --> 00:31:37.643

<i>and stolen elections do,</i>

326

- Yeah!

329
00:31:46.317 --> 00:31:51.114
Then let's hear it for the
East Highland Blackhawks!

330
00:32:01.665 --> 00:32:03.834
Yeah, Nate!

331
00:32:36.615 --> 00:32:38.700
Hey, let's go!

332
00:32:42.370 --> 00:32:46.040
I, 100 percent,
do not feel safe right now.

333
00:32:46.207 --> 00:32:49.293
No. So stay
the fuck out of my grill.

334
00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:52.421
-Yo, Maddy.
-What?

335
00:32:52.588 --> 00:32:56.925
- Let me take you out tonight.
- Why?

336
00:32:59.845 --> 00:33:02.681
-I hate you.
-I know.

337
00:33:04.641 --> 00:33:06.685
Seriously?

338
00:33:06.851 --> 00:33:08.812
Seriously?

339
00:33:08.978 --> 00:33:11.189
Seriously.

340
00:33:11.356 --> 00:33:15.109
-I'm over it.
-Rue!

341
00:33:15.276 --> 00:33:17.778
Breathing is clearly not
a priority to you.

342
00:33:17.945 --> 00:33:20.197
- Ding, ding, ding!
- I see. Oh...

343
00:33:24.743 --> 00:33:26.828
Fuck.

344
00:33:26.995 --> 00:33:29.581
Uh, you wanna come over
for dinner tonight?

345
00:33:29.748 --> 00:33:34.461
I wish. But my dad wants to have like
a capital F, capital D Family Dinner.

346
00:33:34.627 --> 00:33:37.088
Which is weird, because it's
literally just me and him

347
00:33:37.255 --> 00:33:39.507
eating dinner together,
like, every single night.

348
00:33:41.676 --> 00:33:43.636
Well, um, what about later?

349
00:33:43.803 --> 00:33:47.848
I'm probably gonna do some homework.
Binge-watch some <i>Madoka Magica.</i>

350
00:33:48.015 --> 00:33:51.310
Okay, well, um,
maybe you could, like,

351
00:33:51.477 --> 00:33:55.564
come over Sunday night, 'cause my
mom's, like, asking me and stuff.

352
00:33:58.191 --> 00:34:01.069
Are you talking
to your momma about me?

353
00:34:01.236 --> 00:34:04.447
No. Shut up.

354
00:34:09.077 --> 00:34:11.662
-Bye, Rue.
-Bye.

355
00:34:15.583 --> 00:34:17.585
<i>I'm such a loser.</i>

356
00:34:40.481 --> 00:34:43.109
Maddy, I just want to say
that I'm sorry.

357
00:34:58.790 --> 00:35:00.833
Cash or credit?

358
00:35:13.637 --> 00:35:16.348
- Christopher McKay.
- Yep.

359
00:35:16.515 --> 00:35:19.518
Drove down from college
for the weekend.

360
00:35:19.685 --> 00:35:21.228
Yep.

361
00:35:23.396 --> 00:35:26.316
So, what's in store
for Friday night, huh?

362
00:35:26.483 --> 00:35:29.068
Uh, you know.
Just... mm.

363
00:35:31.529 --> 00:35:34.740
Cassie's smitten like
a kitten with you.

364
00:35:34.907 --> 00:35:37.993
Yeah?
Yeah, she's a pretty cool girl.

365
00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:41.580
Well, I tell ya, it's not
easy to hold her attention.

366
00:35:41.747 --> 00:35:44.917
Uh-uh. Like mother,
like daughter.

367
00:35:45.083 --> 00:35:49.504
But she's a good girl.
She's got a good heart.

368
00:35:49.671 --> 00:35:51.715
Yeah. Handle with care.

369
00:35:53.383 --> 00:35:56.886
-I will.
-Mom, stop talking to him.

370
00:35:57.053 --> 00:35:59.263
Excuse me.
I've been dismissed.

371
00:35:59.430 --> 00:36:03.434
You have fun.
Ooh, you look so pretty.

372
00:36:05.728 --> 00:36:08.772
Hey. Want to watch a movie?

373
00:36:10.524 --> 00:36:12.651
Yeah, come on.

374
00:36:18.031 --> 00:36:21.368
Maddy. Why don't you let me
take you out tonight?

375
00:36:21.534 --> 00:36:24.412
I don't know.
Text me.

376
00:36:54.482 --> 00:36:59.153
All right.
No cell phones during dinner.

377
00:37:03.407 --> 00:37:07.035
I don't think I have an attention
span for real life anymore.

378
00:37:07.202 --> 00:37:09.788
Shut up, you smart ass.

379
00:37:37.856 --> 00:37:39.941
<i>Hey, open the door!</i>

380
00:37:44.279 --> 00:37:46.739
- What do you want?
<i>- Open the fucking door.</i>

381
00:37:51.744 --> 00:37:53.788
- Yo, who is it, man?
<i>- Rue.</i>

382
00:37:53.955 --> 00:37:56.791
No, bro, tell her to
come back later. Yo.

383
00:37:56.957 --> 00:37:59.627
-Too late, bitch.
-Hold on, hold on.

384
00:37:59.793 --> 00:38:02.045
-You can be in here right now.
-I see you, cash money.

385
00:38:02.212 --> 00:38:05.507
-Nah, nah.
-I need some some OCs and some socks.

386
00:38:05.674 --> 00:38:08.051
I can't help you
right now. You gotta go.

387
00:38:08.218 --> 00:38:10.929
Yo, for real, Rue. I ain't fuckin'
playing with you. Come on.

388
00:38:11.096 --> 00:38:13.264
-You can't be in here.
-Look, Fez,

389
00:38:13.431 --> 00:38:16.184
I'm fucking drenched.
Okay?

390
00:38:16.351 --> 00:38:21.439
And, uh... I'm out of drugs. So...
Don't be a dick.

391
00:38:21.606 --> 00:38:23.858
Oh, my God.
That's not my fucking problem.

392
00:38:24.024 --> 00:38:25.734
You gotta get up
out of my house right now

393
00:38:25.901 --> 00:38:27.528
before these motherfuckers
come through.

394
00:38:27.695 --> 00:38:30.614
All I need is a couple OCs,
and some Xannies.

395
00:38:30.781 --> 00:38:32.658
That's all
I need, and I can be gone.

396
00:38:32.824 --> 00:38:35.827
Yo, I'm trying to tell you, I
don't got shit right now. Like...

397
00:38:35.994 --> 00:38:38.580
Come back in a few hours,
I got you, whatever you need.

398
00:38:38.747 --> 00:38:41.457
But right now, you gotta get
the fuck up outta my house.

399
00:38:41.624 --> 00:38:43.167
I know you have something, Fez.

400
00:38:43.334 --> 00:38:46.587
I'm just telling you, I don't
got shit for you, Rue, come on.

401
00:38:46.754 --> 00:38:48.839
I need you out the house right now.

402
00:38:49.006 --> 00:38:51.092
My guy's about to come through here.
I don't want you here

403
00:38:51.258 --> 00:38:52.968
when he gets here, you understand?

404
00:38:53.135 --> 00:38:56.430
- Give me drugs.
- This is dead serious.

405
00:38:56.597 --> 00:38:58.432
Yo, Rue.

406
00:39:12.362 --> 00:39:15.406
I could fucking kill you right now.

407
00:39:18.659 --> 00:39:21.078
Yo, Ash, they're here.

408
00:39:32.547 --> 00:39:34.257
Look, I'm serious, Rue.

409
00:39:34.424 --> 00:39:38.469
Just stay right there, keep
your mouth shut, and be cool.

410
00:39:38.636 --> 00:39:41.097
These dudes ain't fucking around.

411
00:39:41.264 --> 00:39:44.225
<i>Now, I'm not gonna lie. That's when</i>
<i>I started to get a little scared.</i>

412
00:39:44.392 --> 00:39:47.853
<i>I mean, I'm all good with drugs</i>
<i>until guns start coming out.</i>

413
00:40:53.248 --> 00:40:54.916
<i>Coming out of East Highland,</i>
<i>I've held the state record</i>

414
00:40:55.083 --> 00:40:57.127
for most receiving yards
the last two years in row.

415
00:40:57.293 --> 00:40:59.045
I broke East Highland records
for the most receptions,

416
00:40:59.212 --> 00:41:01.089
the most yards
during the game: 112,

417
00:41:01.256 --> 00:41:03.299
most yards per catch,
most yards after the catch.

418
00:41:03.466 --> 00:41:05.885
And I can fucking block.

419
00:41:06.052 --> 00:41:08.095
And this coach is acting like
he don't want to start me.

420
00:41:08.262 --> 00:41:11.682
Like I haven't earned my due on the
field or something. That's bullshit.

421
00:41:11.849 --> 00:41:13.934
Don't they do that to,
like, all the freshmen?

422
00:41:14.101 --> 00:41:19.106
I'm not all freshman. Look at my stats.
Shit pisses me off. I don't get it.

423
00:41:23.109 --> 00:41:26.488
-You want to kill him?
-What?

424
00:41:26.654 --> 00:41:28.990
Let's fucking kill him.

425
00:41:32.910 --> 00:41:34.912
Cass, I'm serious.

426
00:41:35.079 --> 00:41:37.039
It's not funny. This motherfucker
really pissed me off.

427
00:41:37.206 --> 00:41:41.085
Come on, McKay.
It just takes time.

428
00:41:48.091 --> 00:41:52.804
I thought about you all week.
I'm dying to fuck you.

429
00:41:56.140 --> 00:41:59.310
Why you gotta make
everything so sexual?

430
00:42:01.270 --> 00:42:02.980
What?

431
00:42:05.274 --> 00:42:08.527
I'm trying to have a real-ass
conversation with you.

432
00:42:10.487 --> 00:42:12.531
I'm... I'm sorry.

433
00:42:18.578 --> 00:42:21.247
It's cool, Cassie.
It's all right.

434
00:42:37.679 --> 00:42:42.517
-So this your little bitch?
-Nah, bruh, that's my little sister.

435
00:42:44.978 --> 00:42:47.564
Well, hello, there, little sis.

436
00:42:49.732 --> 00:42:51.943
<i>Now, when Fez said</i>
<i>his dudes were coming over,</i>

437
00:42:52.110 --> 00:42:55.571
<i>I didn't think his dude</i>
<i>would be this dude.</i>

438
00:42:55.738 --> 00:42:59.158
My name is Mouse.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

439
00:42:59.325 --> 00:43:03.120
<i>But you know, that's what happens</i>
<i>when you hang out with drug dealers.</i>

440
00:43:03.287 --> 00:43:05.247
Yo, Custer, toss me that bag.

441
00:43:06.665 --> 00:43:08.292
All right, check it.

442
00:43:08.458 --> 00:43:13.255
I got a 100 OP-OC 80s,
500 Xanny bars, 500 20s of Addy.

443
00:43:13.421 --> 00:43:15.882
I'm low on Vikes, so if
you wanna cop some Vikes,

444
00:43:16.049 --> 00:43:18.301
you better cop 'em today,
'cause I got, like, 50 left.

445
00:43:18.468 --> 00:43:22.472
I got a quap of that Cali
medicinal, and an ounce of Molly.

446
00:43:22.638 --> 00:43:27.143
-Custer, what's the math on that?
-Uh, 25, 15, and 1,100,

447
00:43:27.309 --> 00:43:32.481
35, 77, and 25...
7,750.

448
00:43:38.779 --> 00:43:40.739
Here.

449
00:43:42.991 --> 00:43:46.911
-Sure you don't want no Fentanyl?
-Nah, man, I'm cool off that shit.

450
00:43:47.078 --> 00:43:50.373
There's too many ODs,
and I don't want the heat.

451
00:43:50.540 --> 00:43:53.793
How about you, little sis?
You ever try Fentanyl?

452
00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:57.046
- No.
- No, she's good, bruh.

453
00:43:58.672 --> 00:44:01.467
Gonna let big brother talk for you?

454
00:44:01.633 --> 00:44:05.470
-I don't know.
-Don't look at him. Look at me.

455
00:44:05.637 --> 00:44:07.639
You ever try it?

456
00:44:08.848 --> 00:44:12.519
Yo, for real, bruh. I don't want
her fucking with that shit.

457
00:44:12.685 --> 00:44:14.395
You know that feeling
when you come so hard

458
00:44:14.562 --> 00:44:16.981
that you can't feel or hear shit?

459
00:44:19.609 --> 00:44:23.237
- You like that feeling?
- Yeah.

460
00:44:23.404 --> 00:44:26.865
Well, shit.
You gonna love this.

461
00:44:33.205 --> 00:44:35.415
I'm... I'm good, actually.

462
00:44:35.582 --> 00:44:39.919
- What, you don't trust me?
- Yo, for real, man. She's good.

463
00:44:40.086 --> 00:44:44.465
Shut the fuck up, bitch.
Ain't nobody talkin' to you.

464
00:44:44.632 --> 00:44:47.802
Tell your big brother I'm not
talking to him right now.

465
00:44:47.969 --> 00:44:50.471
Tell him,
"Shut the fuck up."

466
00:44:50.638 --> 00:44:54.224
Come on. Don't be scared.
It's not gonna bite you.

467
00:44:54.391 --> 00:44:56.477
Come on. Try it.

468
00:45:04.442 --> 00:45:06.611
Oh, just try it.

469
00:45:09.072 --> 00:45:11.491
<i>Dear God, I know I've been a cunt</i>
<i>for, like, a lot of my life,</i>

470
00:45:11.658 --> 00:45:15.661
<i>and my family</i>
and I am <i>so, so, so sorry, but...</i>

471
00:45:15.828 --> 00:45:18.372
<i>just please, God, I'm begging you,</i>

472
00:45:18.539 --> 00:45:22.042
<i>do not let me die tonight.</i>

473
00:45:41.394 --> 00:45:44.355
-Welcome home.
-Fuck!

474
00:45:44.522 --> 00:45:47.608
-What the fuck, man?
-Hi, Tyler.

475
00:45:47.775 --> 00:45:51.028
What the fuck are you doing here, man?
Get the fuck out of my apartment.

476
00:45:51.195 --> 00:45:53.864
If you're looking for the
kitchen knives, they're here.

477
00:45:54.031 --> 00:45:56.616
Same with the baseball bat
from your room.

478
00:45:59.619 --> 00:46:01.788
Who the fuck are you, man?

479
00:46:03.289 --> 00:46:06.376
I'm the boyfriend of the girl
that you raped on Saturday night.

480
00:46:08.878 --> 00:46:11.547
No, no. Dude, what the fuck?
I wouldn't rape anyone.

481
00:46:11.714 --> 00:46:15.134
I swear to God,
I didn't rape a girl, dude.

482
00:46:15.301 --> 00:46:17.344
But I saw it.

483
00:46:17.511 --> 00:46:22.015
-You saw what?
-I saw you rape her in the pool.

484
00:46:25.727 --> 00:46:29.189
Wait a minute. You're talking about that
crazy chick that was at the party?

485
00:46:29.356 --> 00:46:33.109
That chick was asking me to.
I was the one that was saying no.

486
00:46:33.276 --> 00:46:36.279
-She was blacked out.
-Dude, she wasn't blacked out, man.

487
00:46:36.446 --> 00:46:40.533
I swear to God, she asked me to fuck
her, like, right here, right now.

488
00:46:41.909 --> 00:46:44.161
Do you know how old she is?

489
00:46:46.872 --> 00:46:50.083
-She's like, 18.
-Try 17.

490
00:46:50.250 --> 00:46:54.838
-Fuck, dude, she didn't say that to me.
-And how old are you?

491
00:46:56.214 --> 00:46:57.799
-I'm like, 21.
-You're 22.

492
00:46:57.966 --> 00:47:00.593
-I mean, barely.
-You turned 22 five months ago, Tyler.

493
00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:03.679
Don't fucking lie to me.

494
00:47:03.846 --> 00:47:07.850
So, not only did you rape a
girl, but you raped a minor.

495
00:47:09.602 --> 00:47:11.312
-I'm gonna hurt you.
-No, no, no, no, no.

496
00:47:11.478 --> 00:47:14.148
Yeah, and you're not gonna press
charges, because if you do,

497
00:47:14.314 --> 00:47:17.192
you're gonna go to jail
for a lot longer than I will...

498
00:47:17.359 --> 00:47:20.028
-Please.
-...depending on what I do to you.

499
00:47:20.195 --> 00:47:22.656
Please, please, please, I am
begging you, please don't do this.

500
00:47:22.822 --> 00:47:25.158
Dude, don't hurt me, please.
Don't do this.

501
00:47:25.325 --> 00:47:27.785
-Get on your knees.
-What?

502
00:47:27.952 --> 00:47:30.288
Get on your knees.

503
00:47:30.455 --> 00:47:33.749
- No. I'm not... -
- Hey, get on your knees. Come on.

504
00:47:35.543 --> 00:47:39.088
Did you seriously think you could rape
a girl and nobody would do anything?

505
00:47:42.633 --> 00:47:46.928
Oh, my God. Fuck!
I didn't do anything, man!

506
00:47:47.095 --> 00:47:49.222
I'm gonna ask you a question.

507
00:47:53.059 --> 00:47:56.104
-Did you rape her?
-No.

508
00:47:56.271 --> 00:47:58.856
-Did you rape her?
-No! Fuck!

509
00:47:59.023 --> 00:48:01.317
Did you rape her?

510
00:48:01.484 --> 00:48:03.152
-Admit it! Did you rape her?
-Fucking ow!

511
00:48:03.319 --> 00:48:05.654
Admit it!
Did you rape her?

512
00:48:05.821 --> 00:48:08.115
Ow! Fuck! No!

513
00:48:08.282 --> 00:48:11.535
Admit it, you fucking faggot!
Did you fucking rape her?

514
00:48:11.702 --> 00:48:15.163
I didn't fucking rape her!

515
00:48:38.435 --> 00:48:40.395
It hits quick.

516
00:48:46.693 --> 00:48:48.903
You like the way that feels?

517
00:48:50.947 --> 00:48:54.742
-Yeah.
-You want a couple of patches, girl?

518
00:48:55.868 --> 00:48:58.663
Okay.

519
00:49:04.752 --> 00:49:07.045
It's gonna cost you 300.

520
00:49:08.797 --> 00:49:14.052
-Come on. Pay up, little sis.
-I only have two dollars.

521
00:49:14.219 --> 00:49:16.638
I said 300.

522
00:49:18.890 --> 00:49:21.684
Where are my pants?

523
00:49:23.561 --> 00:49:27.064
I'll just...
I'll just give it back.

524
00:49:27.231 --> 00:49:32.027
-I got a strict no-return policy.
-Yo, Mouse. Let me pay for it, man.

525
00:49:32.194 --> 00:49:35.113
I thought you was too good
for Fentanyl.

526
00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:38.492
What is it? Everybody's changing
their motherfucking minds on me?

527
00:49:38.658 --> 00:49:40.827
Yeah.

528
00:49:42.537 --> 00:49:46.374
If she can't afford it, she gonna have
to find another way of paying me.

529
00:49:46.541 --> 00:49:48.209
- Straight up.
- Okay.

530
00:49:48.376 --> 00:49:50.878
Yo, man, just let me pay for it.

531
00:49:54.965 --> 00:49:57.009
I got the money right here.

532
00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:01.346
Here.

533
00:50:01.513 --> 00:50:03.515
Dang. Big brother
must love you.

534
00:50:03.682 --> 00:50:05.892
It's gonna cost you 600 now, man.

535
00:50:06.059 --> 00:50:08.603
Damn. You gonna do me
like that, bruh?

536
00:50:08.770 --> 00:50:10.897
Yeah, I'm gonna do you
like that. Straight up.

537
00:50:11.064 --> 00:50:14.525
Get that shit.
There it is.

538
00:50:20.573 --> 00:50:23.826
It's always a pleasure
doing business with you.

539
00:50:31.041 --> 00:50:33.168
Go flush that shit down the toilet,

540
00:50:33.335 --> 00:50:36.546
and go grab the Narcan,
just in case.

541
00:50:57.608 --> 00:50:59.818
I'm so happy.

542
00:51:04.739 --> 00:51:06.908
I know.

543
00:52:57.637 --> 00:52:59.889
<i>Yo, what's up? It's Fez.</i>

544
00:53:00.056 --> 00:53:03.101
Yeah, look. I'm gonna need
a little help with Rue.

545
00:53:04.685 --> 00:53:06.896
Yeah. ASAP.

546
00:54:51.494 --> 00:54:53.830
Holy shit...

547
00:55:37.788 --> 00:55:41.750
-That guy you fucked in the pool?
-What?

548
00:55:41.916 --> 00:55:44.502
Are you sure you don't remember?

549
00:55:45.879 --> 00:55:47.797
I don't believe you.

550
00:55:47.964 --> 00:55:51.175
-Was it good?
-What?

551
00:55:51.342 --> 00:55:55.054
-The sex.
-What do you want to know, Nate?

552
00:55:55.221 --> 00:55:58.265
You want to know
if his dick was bigger?

553
00:55:58.432 --> 00:56:01.351
-Was it?
-What if it was?

554
00:56:02.519 --> 00:56:03.895
I'd fucking kill him.

555
00:56:04.062 --> 00:56:06.982
Yeah, but dead or alive, he'd still
have a bigger dick than you.

556
00:56:36.426 --> 00:56:38.470
I got you a present.

557
00:56:39.596 --> 00:56:41.556
Thank you.
