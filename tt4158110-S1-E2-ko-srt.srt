1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,431
지금 내가 알려주는 건
일급 비밀이야

2
00:00:03,796 --> 00:00:04,966
이빌 주식회사

3
00:00:05,804 --> 00:00:07,283
안녕하세요
타렐 윌릭입니다

4
00:00:07,284 --> 00:00:08,613
나랑 이거 같이 할래?

5
00:00:08,614 --> 00:00:10,659
- 순수한 몰리야
- 됐어, 샤일라

6
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:12,227
올세이프로 빨리 와

7
00:00:12,228 --> 00:00:13,461
젠장, 네트워크까지 당했어

8
00:00:13,462 --> 00:00:15,685
에프 소사이어티
해커의 정체다

9
00:00:15,686 --> 00:00:17,264
왠지 지우면 안될것 같아

10
00:00:19,041 --> 00:00:20,135
누구세요?

11
00:00:20,136 --> 00:00:21,469
나랑 같이 가자

12
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:22,804
쟤는 달린이야

13
00:00:22,805 --> 00:00:24,889
DAT 파일을 수정해서

14
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:26,473
콜비의 IP주소를 끼워넣어

15
00:00:26,525 --> 00:00:28,059
그렇게 하면

16
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:30,692
세계에서 가장 큰 혁명의
시발점이 되는거야

17
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:35,734
정보에 의하면
해커들은 콜비와

18
00:00:35,735 --> 00:00:37,902
유착관계에 있는 것으로
드러났습니다

19
00:00:37,903 --> 00:00:40,487
차에 타시죠

20
00:00:45,878 --> 00:00:47,544
안녕, 엘리엇

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,074
사이트에 기여하거나 VIP멤버를 가입하셨을 경우, www.OpenSubtitles.org의 광고가 사라집니다.

22
00:01:11,187 --> 00:01:13,555
총이 있으면, 그 사람은
은행을 털 수 있다

23
00:01:13,556 --> 00:01:17,592
하지만 은행이 있으면
그 자는 세상을 털 수 있다

24
00:01:17,593 --> 00:01:19,994
멍청한 소리죠

25
00:01:19,995 --> 00:01:22,396
환원주의적이고

26
00:01:22,397 --> 00:01:24,366
하지만 전
이 표현이 좋아요

27
00:01:24,367 --> 00:01:26,334
사람들 대부분은 싫어하죠

28
00:01:26,335 --> 00:01:29,112
권력은 그것을 쟁취한 자에게

29
00:01:29,113 --> 00:01:31,740
속한다는 걸 의미하니깐요

30
00:01:31,741 --> 00:01:34,409
아무리 열심히 일해도,
아무리 크게 꿈을 꿔도

31
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:37,712
능력이 아무리 적합해도
다 소용없어요

32
00:01:37,713 --> 00:01:42,759
실천 의지만이
가장 필요한 조건인거죠

33
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:45,490
이렇게 모시게 되서
유감스러울 따름이에요

34
00:01:45,491 --> 00:01:47,307
사실 저희가 지금 하는게

35
00:01:47,308 --> 00:01:48,923
불법적이라
간주될 수 있거든요

36
00:01:48,924 --> 00:01:50,725
그 때문에 제가 지금

37
00:01:50,726 --> 00:01:53,787
변호사 11명에게
둘러쌓여있는 거겠죠

38
00:01:56,339 --> 00:01:58,830
엘리엇 올더슨

39
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:02,010
당신에게...

40
00:02:02,104 --> 00:02:06,511
이빌 사의 자리를
제안하고 싶군요

41
00:02:07,076 --> 00:02:10,744
저희 사이버보안 부서의
책임자가 되어주세요

42
00:02:10,745 --> 00:02:13,748
저희가 올세이프가
경쟁금지 조약이 있는 탓에

43
00:02:13,749 --> 00:02:18,253
이를 공식적으로
제안할 수는 없습니다

44
00:02:18,254 --> 00:02:20,093
그렇기 때문에

45
00:02:20,094 --> 00:02:22,640
엘리엇 씨가
자진해서 오신다면

46
00:02:22,641 --> 00:02:27,095
5년 이내 백만장자가
되실 수 있어요

47
00:02:27,096 --> 00:02:29,096
어떻게 하실래요?

48
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:39,606
좀 더...

49
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:43,610
좀 더 생각해봐도 될까요?

50
00:02:48,784 --> 00:02:51,535
여러분, 자리 좀 비켜주시죠

51
00:02:51,587 --> 00:02:53,837
괜찮아요, 압니다

52
00:03:12,691 --> 00:03:14,892
알다시피

53
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:19,146
이빌 사는 저를
임시 CTO로 임명했어요

54
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:21,982
공식 지위가 되는데는
얼마 안걸릴 거에요

55
00:03:22,034 --> 00:03:26,564
제가 이 회사에서
가장 젊은 경영진이 되겠죠

56
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:29,324
해커들한테 따로 전화해서

57
00:03:29,325 --> 00:03:31,408
감사인사라도 하고싶을
정도라니깐요

58
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,628
한편으론, 음..

59
00:03:33,629 --> 00:03:35,997
뭐라고 하더라..

60
00:03:35,998 --> 00:03:38,999
어부지리랄까요?

61
00:03:55,317 --> 00:03:59,074
분기말까지 저희는

62
00:03:59,075 --> 00:04:01,188
네트워크를 개편하고

63
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,858
보안 프로토콜을 통합할거에요

64
00:04:03,859 --> 00:04:06,765
저희는 모든 걸
내부적으로 관리할겁니다

65
00:04:06,766 --> 00:04:09,780
그말인 즉슨
올세이프를 포함한

66
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:11,699
다른 계약 업체와
연을 끊게 되는거죠

67
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,035
그렇게 되면, 알다시피
올세이프의 미래는

68
00:04:15,087 --> 00:04:17,038
끝났다고 할 수 있죠

69
00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:18,706
그 일이 일어나게 되면

70
00:04:18,707 --> 00:04:21,291
당신이 속한 곳으로
오기 바랍니다

71
00:04:21,343 --> 00:04:23,172
바로 여기죠

72
00:04:23,173 --> 00:04:25,884
중대한 결정이란거 알아요

73
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:29,706
당신이 마지막 결정을
내리기 전에

74
00:04:29,707 --> 00:04:32,352
정보를 주고싶었을 뿐이에요

75
00:04:43,732 --> 00:04:46,648
저는 지금 있는 곳에
만족해요

76
00:05:11,447 --> 00:05:14,428
잘 생각해보세요

77
00:05:33,878 --> 00:05:37,896
MR. ROBOT

79
00:05:56,472 --> 00:05:58,972
이 번호로 연락하시면 됩니다

80
00:05:59,024 --> 00:06:02,547
저는 미스터 엑스라고 부르세요

81
00:06:04,813 --> 00:06:07,815
이봐요, 영화 JFK도 안봤어요?

82
00:06:07,816 --> 00:06:10,651
올리버 스톤 감독?

83
00:06:10,652 --> 00:06:13,070
썰렁한 반응은 처음이라
좀 당황스럽네요

84
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:15,214
정말 좋은 영화니깐
꼭 보세요

85
00:06:15,215 --> 00:06:17,158
불법다운 하진 마시고요

86
00:06:17,159 --> 00:06:19,660
아무튼, 저는
서더랜드라고 부르세요

87
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:23,164
마음의 준비가 되면
언제든지 연락 주세요

88
00:06:23,165 --> 00:06:25,666
저희는 항상
가까이 있습니다

89
00:06:36,078 --> 00:06:37,594
날짜를 지금 정하자

90
00:06:37,646 --> 00:06:39,096
- 싫어
- 이따 봐

91
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:40,263
나 가야해, 고마워

92
00:06:40,315 --> 00:06:42,150
- 나 안 데려갈거야?
- 싫어

93
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:44,519
- 정말 안 데려갈거야?
- 싫다니깐, 그만해

94
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,688
- 너랑 같이 올라갈래
- 싫어

95
00:06:46,689 --> 00:06:48,271
다음에 하자
나 가야해

96
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:56,863
- 괜찮아?
- 그냥 추근덕대는 거야

97
00:06:56,915 --> 00:07:01,451
눈치 없는 놈들은
정말 짜증나

98
00:07:05,507 --> 00:07:07,208
근데 너네 집
난방기도 고장났어?

99
00:07:07,209 --> 00:07:10,510
너무 뜨거워서
쪄죽을 것 같다니깐

100
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:15,048
엘리엇, 괜찮아?
정신이 나가 보여

101
00:07:17,052 --> 00:07:19,803
혹시 지금 약 좀
더 살수 있을까?

102
00:07:19,804 --> 00:07:21,689
좀 이른 시간이지 않아?

103
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:24,474
오늘은 좀 일탈하고 싶어서

104
00:07:24,526 --> 00:07:28,202
원칙주의자 씨한테
이런 모습을 볼 줄은 몰랐는데

105
00:07:28,203 --> 00:07:30,565
알겠어

106
00:07:30,566 --> 00:07:33,234
아, 맞다
다른 약이 다 떨어졌어

107
00:07:33,235 --> 00:07:36,070
괜찮아, 모르핀만 있음 돼

108
00:07:36,071 --> 00:07:38,239
*섭옥손 없이는
(아편 의존증 치료제)

109
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,074
약 절대 주지 않기로
나랑 약속했잖아

110
00:07:40,075 --> 00:07:43,377
- 샤일라
- 안 돼, 엘리엇

111
00:07:43,378 --> 00:07:45,246
우리 약속했잖아

112
00:07:45,247 --> 00:07:47,617
약속은 중요해

113
00:07:54,575 --> 00:07:56,257
이번 한번만 봐줄게

114
00:07:56,258 --> 00:07:58,092
대신 해독제 없이는
과다복용하지 않기로 약속해

115
00:07:58,093 --> 00:08:01,929
이따 페르난도가
올 것 같거든

116
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:03,764
내가 뭐라고 했지?

117
00:08:06,985 --> 00:08:08,268
알았어, 약속할게

118
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,782
안녕, 여러분

119
00:08:20,783 --> 00:08:22,866
내가 당신을 잊은 줄 알았어?

120
00:08:22,918 --> 00:08:26,169
걱정마, 지금 당신이 필요해

121
00:08:29,174 --> 00:08:31,292
일해야 하거든

122
00:08:31,293 --> 00:08:33,461
타이렐 웰릭을 해킹하는게
복잡할거라 생각하겠지만

123
00:08:33,462 --> 00:08:35,712
사실은 엄청 쉬워

124
00:08:35,764 --> 00:08:37,799
이빌 사 메일 서버는 지난번 이후로
아직 아무 조치도 안했거든

125
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,800
웰릭은 본인확인 2단계도
쓰지 않더라니깐

126
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,803
비밀번호는 아내의
처녀적 이름에

127
00:08:41,804 --> 00:08:44,872
스웨덴 독립일
6월 6일 조합이군

128
00:08:44,873 --> 00:08:47,141
너무 간단해 보이지만

129
00:08:47,142 --> 00:08:50,143
이건 그냥 시도해보는거야

130
00:08:52,447 --> 00:08:54,447
이메일을 보니

131
00:08:57,452 --> 00:09:00,521
그의 삶은 행복하고
너무나 완벽하군

132
00:09:00,522 --> 00:09:03,124
이건 말이 안돼

133
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:07,829
내가 해킹할 걸
예상하고 있었나?

134
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,830
일부러 해킹하게 둔건가?

135
00:09:12,551 --> 00:09:15,051
모든 걸 지워야 겠어

136
00:10:09,466 --> 00:10:12,226
나도 알아, 평상시보다
더많이 하고 있는거

137
00:10:12,227 --> 00:10:14,482
계속 규칙을 깨고있네

138
00:10:14,483 --> 00:10:16,394
에이, 그래도
쉬는 날이잖아

139
00:10:54,269 --> 00:10:56,236
얼른

140
00:10:59,608 --> 00:11:02,443
멍멍아
너 여기서...

141
00:11:02,444 --> 00:11:05,161
여기서 볼일 봐야해

142
00:11:07,282 --> 00:11:11,452
쌀 거면 여기서 싸
알겠지?

143
00:11:11,453 --> 00:11:12,619
얼른

144
00:11:13,914 --> 00:11:16,116
넌 할수 있어

145
00:11:16,117 --> 00:11:18,315
넌 할수 있다고

146
00:11:44,736 --> 00:11:47,866
이빌 사 CTO 테리 콜비는...

147
00:11:47,867 --> 00:11:50,240
모두가 테리 콜비에
대해서 떠들어댄다

148
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:55,329
티비마다 똑같은 뉴스가
계속 나온다

149
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:57,331
어떻게 일상으로 돌아가지?

150
00:11:57,332 --> 00:11:59,333
일이 손에 잡히지 않는다

151
00:11:59,334 --> 00:12:01,836
미스터 로봇은
언제쯤 연락올까?

152
00:12:01,837 --> 00:12:04,005
뭘 기다리는 거지?

153
00:12:04,006 --> 00:12:07,257
설마 내가 아무 이유 없이
한 남자의 인생을 끝장낸건가?

154
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:09,759
인사과에 얘기해서
자네 연봉을 인상할까 하네

155
00:12:09,811 --> 00:12:11,177
- 저는 괜찮아요
- 아니

156
00:12:11,229 --> 00:12:13,096
인상분을 받게

157
00:12:13,148 --> 00:12:17,351
큰 액수는 아니겠지만
내가 할 수 있는 최선이네

158
00:12:17,352 --> 00:12:18,685
엘리엇

159
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:20,737
자네가 회사를 구한거야

160
00:12:23,992 --> 00:12:25,675
그럼 이제...

161
00:12:27,863 --> 00:12:31,281
왜 내게 DAT 파일이
있다고 말 안했나?

162
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,909
회의에 들어가기 전에
나한테 말할 수도 있었잖나

163
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:36,063
하지만 그러지 않았지

164
00:12:36,064 --> 00:12:39,611
그 이유가 궁금하네

165
00:12:42,377 --> 00:12:45,616
당시에 제가 뭘
찾은건지 몰랐어요

166
00:12:45,617 --> 00:12:48,548
그저 무의미한
파일일 수 있으니깐요

167
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:50,967
자네는 절대 단언하지 않잖아

168
00:12:51,019 --> 00:12:54,055
무언가 확실하기 전에는 말이야

169
00:12:54,056 --> 00:12:57,857
사장님이 저에 대해
잘못 생각한 걸지도요

170
00:12:59,861 --> 00:13:02,229
어쨌든 간에..

171
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:05,733
현재 상황에선 자네가
그 누구보다 필요하네

172
00:13:05,734 --> 00:13:08,736
에프 소사이어티 해커가
다음에 또 무슨짓을 할지 누가 알겠어

173
00:13:08,737 --> 00:13:10,320
그가 뭐라고 한거지?

174
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:13,407
- 뭐라고 하셨죠?
- 콜비랑 일한 놈들 말이야

175
00:13:13,408 --> 00:13:15,909
데이터 저장소에 무슨 정보가
있을지 다 꿰뚫고 있었지

176
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,077
이빌 사는...

177
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,662
무슨 말씀이시죠?

178
00:13:19,714 --> 00:13:21,582
새로운 국면을 맞았네

179
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,583
자네가 이미
알고 있는 줄 알았는데

180
00:13:23,635 --> 00:13:25,920
그들이 결함을 찾아내
시스템 본체를 해킹했어

181
00:13:25,921 --> 00:13:29,256
테라바이트 수준의
이메일과 파일을 복제하고

182
00:13:29,257 --> 00:13:31,158
FBI가 콜비를 풀어주지 않으면

183
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:33,343
정보를 모두 유출하겠다고
협박하고 있네

184
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:36,396
오늘 아침에
비디오가 올라왔어

185
00:13:43,271 --> 00:13:45,187
안녕하신가, 이빌 주식회사

186
00:13:45,188 --> 00:13:46,838
우리는 에프 소사이어티다

187
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:49,003
지난 몇 년동안
우리는 당신을 감시해왔다

188
00:13:49,004 --> 00:13:50,777
빈곤층에 대한
경제적 학대

189
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:52,612
정부에 대한 비리

190
00:13:52,664 --> 00:13:55,782
무고한 시민을 죽이고선
은폐 공작행위까지

191
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:57,785
모두 다 돈을 위해
한 짓이었지

192
00:13:57,786 --> 00:13:59,839
그게 바로 우리
에프 소사이어티가

193
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,006
이빌 사에 사형선고를
내리는 이유다

194
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:04,074
우리는 당신들을 혐오한다

195
00:14:04,075 --> 00:14:06,076
우리는 절대
타협하지 않을 것이다

196
00:14:06,077 --> 00:14:07,313
우리는 끝까지 갈 것이다

197
00:14:07,314 --> 00:14:11,241
흉물스러운 악의 촉수가
하나 하나 끊어질 때까지

198
00:14:11,242 --> 00:14:13,299
우리는 멈추지 않을 것이다

199
00:14:13,351 --> 00:14:15,635
우리는 자비를 베풀지 않는다

200
00:14:15,687 --> 00:14:18,305
이번 해킹은
마지막 경고이다

201
00:14:18,306 --> 00:14:21,978
우리의 요구를 받아들이면
당신을 파괴하지 않겠다

202
00:14:21,979 --> 00:14:24,561
첫째로, 불법적인 감옥에서

203
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:27,148
우리의 지도자 테리 콜비를
당장 석방하라

204
00:14:27,149 --> 00:14:30,184
둘째, 더욱 악질적인
불법적인 빚의 감옥에서

205
00:14:30,185 --> 00:14:33,570
세상 모든 사람들을 석방하라

206
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:36,157
세번째, 이빌 사를 해체하고

207
00:14:36,158 --> 00:14:39,826
모든 자산을
전 세계에 기부해라

208
00:14:39,878 --> 00:14:42,229
우리는 협상을
받지 않는다

209
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:43,902
당신들이 존재하는 한

210
00:14:43,903 --> 00:14:46,332
사람들은 선택의 자유가
없다는 것을 알고 있다

211
00:14:46,384 --> 00:14:48,335
사람들은 깨어나고 있다

212
00:14:48,336 --> 00:14:51,172
더이상 당신의 경제적
노예로 있지 않을것이다

213
00:14:51,173 --> 00:14:55,008
요구를 받지 않는다면,
우리는 당신을 없앨 것이다

214
00:14:55,009 --> 00:14:56,843
경고를 받아들이도록

215
00:14:56,844 --> 00:14:59,047
에프 소사이어티

216
00:15:01,683 --> 00:15:02,982
다시 틀어주세요

217
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,832
여보게들, 제 앨범이 나왔어요

218
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:09,734
좋아요 20번만 눌러주시면
CD 공짜로 드릴게요

219
00:15:09,786 --> 00:15:12,070
느낌 있는 노래에요
제 장담해요

220
00:15:12,071 --> 00:15:13,405
공짜 CD라니깐요
트윗만 해주시면 돼요

221
00:15:13,406 --> 00:15:15,401
SNS로 홍보해주시면 됩니다

222
00:15:15,402 --> 00:15:19,170
이번 미팅을
조정하려 했는데...

223
00:15:19,171 --> 00:15:20,682
여어, 엘리엇!

224
00:15:20,683 --> 00:15:22,141
축하한다, 짜샤

225
00:15:22,142 --> 00:15:24,798
네 덕에 올세이프가
인터넷에 도배됐다고

226
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:27,284
우리 축하 파티하는건 어때?

227
00:15:27,285 --> 00:15:29,287
모튼스에서 목요일날
4명짜리 식사쿠폰 있거든

228
00:15:29,288 --> 00:15:31,456
같이 가자했던
다른 커플이 안된다던데

229
00:15:31,457 --> 00:15:32,791
너는 어때? 생각없어?

230
00:15:32,792 --> 00:15:34,826
거기 스테이크 진짜 맛있어
3만원짜리인데...

231
00:15:34,827 --> 00:15:35,961
엘리엇은 별로
가고 싶어 하지 않을거야

232
00:15:35,962 --> 00:15:37,045
알겠어, 좋아

233
00:15:37,046 --> 00:15:39,631
가는거다? 좋아

234
00:15:39,632 --> 00:15:42,634
그럼 우리
더블 데이트로 안할래?

235
00:15:42,635 --> 00:15:44,052
너 여자친구
생겼다고 들었는데

236
00:15:44,053 --> 00:15:46,221
올리, 모르는 척 하라니깐

237
00:15:46,222 --> 00:15:47,638
엘리엇도 괜찮다잖아

238
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:49,975
알겠어
근데 나 지금 가야겠다

239
00:15:49,976 --> 00:15:53,560
우리집 개가 자꾸 짖는다고
이웃집에서 뭐라 해서 말이야

240
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,404
- 엘리엇이 개를 키운다고?
- 여보시게들

241
00:16:02,405 --> 00:16:03,488
잘 어울리는 한쌍이네요

242
00:16:03,489 --> 00:16:04,739
제가 새로 앨범을 냈어요

243
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,241
랩이나 힙합 좋아하세요?

244
00:16:06,242 --> 00:16:08,576
엄청 시적이고 심오한
음악이거든요

245
00:16:08,577 --> 00:16:10,245
분명 여자친구가 좋아할거에요

246
00:16:10,246 --> 00:16:12,664
2주 넘게 여기서
이러시는거 알아요

247
00:16:12,665 --> 00:16:13,999
CD 받을테니깐

248
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,332
더이상 말걸지 마세요

249
00:16:15,384 --> 00:16:17,335
고마워요, 정말 고마워요

250
00:16:17,336 --> 00:16:19,503
음악 좋으면 트윗할게요
됐죠?

251
00:16:19,555 --> 00:16:21,423
48명밖에 팔로워가 없지만
뭐, 늘어날거에요

252
00:16:21,424 --> 00:16:23,008
물론이죠

253
00:16:23,009 --> 00:16:24,092
좋은 삘이 와요

254
00:16:24,093 --> 00:16:25,343
- 잘 가요
- 넵

255
00:16:25,344 --> 00:16:26,677
고마워요, 형님

256
00:16:26,729 --> 00:16:28,096
- 좋은 하루 되세요
- 당신도요

257
00:16:28,097 --> 00:16:29,431
정말 고마워요!
2번 트랙 꼭 들어봐요

258
00:16:29,432 --> 00:16:32,350
- 2번 트랙이요
- 알겠어요

259
00:16:32,351 --> 00:16:33,768
이건 계획과는 다르다

260
00:16:33,769 --> 00:16:36,071
정보 유출?
테리 콜비를 풀어달라고?

261
00:16:36,072 --> 00:16:37,855
이 모든건
말이 되지 않는다

262
00:16:37,907 --> 00:16:40,442
에프 소사이어티와
모든 연을 끊어야 한다

263
00:16:40,443 --> 00:16:41,860
거기서 나와야 해

264
00:16:41,861 --> 00:16:43,577
병가를 내고
당분간 잠수를 타야지

265
00:16:59,712 --> 00:17:02,714
젠장!
나 알몸이라고

266
00:17:02,715 --> 00:17:04,549
쳐다보지 마

267
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:06,301
왜 우리집에서
샤워하고 있는거야

268
00:17:06,302 --> 00:17:08,386
널 기다리고 있었거든

269
00:17:08,387 --> 00:17:09,720
어제 온다고 했잖아

270
00:17:09,772 --> 00:17:12,222
- 벌써 잊은거야?
- 어디로 간다 했는데?

271
00:17:12,274 --> 00:17:14,274
걱정마, 모두들
나중에 올테니깐

272
00:17:20,649 --> 00:17:23,151
옷 좀 빌릴게

273
00:17:23,152 --> 00:17:26,704
내 원피스에 뭐가
묻어서 말이야

274
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:30,836
바보야, 너 놀려본거야

275
00:17:30,837 --> 00:17:32,917
내 옷은 지금
세탁기에 있어

276
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:35,108
그동안 니 옷좀 빌릴게

277
00:17:35,581 --> 00:17:37,332
그나저나

278
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:39,834
니네 강아지가
침대에 오줌 쌌더라

279
00:17:39,835 --> 00:17:42,371
산책 좀 시켜

280
00:17:43,077 --> 00:17:46,091
샤일라, 플리퍼 좀
잠깐 맡아줘

281
00:17:46,092 --> 00:17:48,093
산책 시켜야 할거야

282
00:17:48,094 --> 00:17:49,928
아무데서나
자꾸 오줌을 싸네

283
00:17:49,929 --> 00:17:51,096
당연히 산책시켜야지

284
00:17:51,097 --> 00:17:52,597
얜 빌어먹을 강아지라고

285
00:17:52,598 --> 00:17:56,100
우리 가기 전에
아이스크림 좀 먹자

286
00:17:57,603 --> 00:18:00,438
곧 돌아올게

287
00:18:00,439 --> 00:18:03,440
- 너한테 신세졌다
- 아주 큰 신세인줄 알아

288
00:18:14,954 --> 00:18:17,188
어디 사는지
어떻게 알았죠?

289
00:18:17,189 --> 00:18:20,024
그걸 왜 모를거라 생각하는데?

290
00:18:20,025 --> 00:18:24,595
글쎄요. 저는 당신이
사는 곳을 모르거든요

291
00:18:26,549 --> 00:18:30,300
나는 지금 아무 곳에서도
살고 있지 않거든

292
00:18:30,352 --> 00:18:34,304
나랑 사귀던 녀석이
나한테 결혼하재, 미친

293
00:18:34,356 --> 00:18:37,058
병신도 그런 병신이 없지

294
00:18:37,059 --> 00:18:39,811
크게 한바탕 했더니
그 녀석이...

295
00:18:39,812 --> 00:18:41,713
지금 뭐하고 있는거지?

296
00:18:41,714 --> 00:18:44,148
저년은 정신이 나갔어

297
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,317
돌아가서 기디언한테
모든걸 털어놓자

298
00:18:46,318 --> 00:18:47,569
그는 이해해줄거야

299
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:48,903
내가 어떻게 해야하는지
알고 있겠지

300
00:18:48,904 --> 00:18:51,156
...그는 나를 잊게될거야

301
00:18:51,157 --> 00:18:52,574
영원한 사랑같은 개소리는

302
00:18:52,575 --> 00:18:55,577
더이상 안하게 되겠지

303
00:18:55,578 --> 00:18:57,494
내가 잠깐만 사라져있으면

304
00:18:57,546 --> 00:18:59,497
걔도 정신을 차리게 되는거지

305
00:18:59,498 --> 00:19:00,665
문이 닫힙니다

306
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:03,251
그게 우리 사이야

307
00:19:03,252 --> 00:19:05,669
얼른 들어가!

308
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,930
얘한테도 저들이 보이나?

309
00:19:15,931 --> 00:19:17,415
왜 그래?

310
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:21,185
나는 서있는걸 좋아하거든

311
00:19:21,237 --> 00:19:25,190
반대 의견을 말하는건
사실 제일 힘든...

312
00:19:25,191 --> 00:19:28,859
타이렐이 이 사실을 알게되면?
그는 어떻게 할까?

313
00:19:28,911 --> 00:19:31,279
빌어먹을, 내가 감옥에 가거나

314
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,031
죽게 되는건
계획에 전혀 없었다고

315
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:37,634
...내가 거북이를 키우고 싶다니깐
그 녀석이 싫다면서...

316
00:19:38,014 --> 00:19:40,121
너한테 며칠 더
신세를 져야 할지도

317
00:19:40,122 --> 00:19:42,372
그래도 괜찮지?

318
00:19:42,424 --> 00:19:44,042
정말 그럴거야?

319
00:19:44,043 --> 00:19:46,377
알겠어. 모블리네 집에서
신세질게

320
00:19:46,378 --> 00:19:48,546
나도 강아지 싫어하니깐 뭐

321
00:19:48,547 --> 00:19:50,298
더군다나 똥오줌
못가리는 놈은 질색이야

322
00:19:50,299 --> 00:19:52,382
어떻게 그런 애를
데리고 살아?

323
00:19:52,434 --> 00:19:54,218
침대에서 냄새날텐데
잠은 어떻게 자?

324
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:57,388
내가 지금 덫을 밟고 있다는
생각이 든다

325
00:19:57,389 --> 00:19:59,556
저 문을 지나치면
우리는 단숨에 죽을지도 몰라

326
00:19:59,608 --> 00:20:03,443
창고 안에서 무시무시한
일이 일어나고 있어

327
00:20:03,444 --> 00:20:05,312
무시무시하다고

328
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,231
유명인 납셨네

329
00:20:21,037 --> 00:20:22,753
빌어먹을 오리들

330
00:20:25,508 --> 00:20:26,958
이봐, 안녕!

331
00:20:27,687 --> 00:20:28,960
앗, 미안

332
00:20:29,012 --> 00:20:30,712
괜찮아

333
00:20:30,713 --> 00:20:32,881
모두 네 덕이야

334
00:20:32,882 --> 00:20:33,965
정말 대단해

335
00:20:34,017 --> 00:20:35,133
자부심을 가져

336
00:20:35,134 --> 00:20:36,885
정말 대단한 걸 해냈어

337
00:20:36,886 --> 00:20:39,054
인사치례 다 끝났으면

338
00:20:39,055 --> 00:20:41,723
이제 계획 좀 들을까?

339
00:20:41,724 --> 00:20:43,141
스틸 산은 어떻게 됐지?

340
00:20:43,142 --> 00:20:44,526
내가 제대로 알고 있다면

341
00:20:44,527 --> 00:20:46,361
여기 회선들은
완전히 안전하지 않아

342
00:20:46,362 --> 00:20:48,069
콜비 프로젝트도
아직 끝나지 않았으니깐

343
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,131
진심으로요?

344
00:20:49,132 --> 00:20:50,418
몇 주나 됐다고요

345
00:20:50,419 --> 00:20:52,568
링크나 흔적들도
이제 처리됐을텐데

346
00:20:52,569 --> 00:20:54,853
회선은 깨끗해요, 보스
제가 장담하죠

347
00:20:54,854 --> 00:20:56,569
고마워

348
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:59,375
하지만 더 안전하길 바란다면
로메로랑 제가 체크할게요

349
00:20:59,376 --> 00:21:01,693
좋았어!
훨씬 안심되는군

350
00:21:01,745 --> 00:21:04,912
난 저기서
생각 좀 정리하지

351
00:21:14,257 --> 00:21:15,707
저 여잔 뭐죠?

352
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:17,626
달린은 복잡한 애야

353
00:21:17,627 --> 00:21:19,762
악성프로그램 코더가
다 그렇지

354
00:21:19,763 --> 00:21:22,046
저희 집에 있더라고요

355
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:23,832
제가 사는델
어떻게 알고 있는거죠?

356
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:25,501
쟤는 신경쓰지마

357
00:21:25,502 --> 00:21:27,391
끝없이 골치만
아파질 뿐이야

358
00:21:27,392 --> 00:21:30,472
프로젝트 다음 단계나
생각하자고

359
00:21:30,473 --> 00:21:34,265
코멧 알지?
*올바니의 천연가스 공장 회사야
(올바니: 뉴욕시의 주도)

360
00:21:36,146 --> 00:21:39,063
우린 그걸 날려버릴거야

361
00:21:39,115 --> 00:21:41,729
올바니를 왜...

362
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:44,190
코멧의 공장은 스틸 산
바로 옆에 있죠

363
00:21:44,191 --> 00:21:45,988
스틸 산은 알다시피

364
00:21:45,989 --> 00:21:49,907
모든 기업의 신용 평가 서비스
데이터를 저장해 놓는 곳이지

365
00:21:49,959 --> 00:21:51,243
거기엔 우리의 친애하는...

366
00:21:51,244 --> 00:21:54,079
- 이빌 사도 있군요
- 정답이야

367
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,582
그들의 백업 데이터를
없애려는 거네요

368
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:58,834
이미 대비하고 있을지도 몰라요

369
00:21:58,835 --> 00:22:01,253
해킹 이후로
보안이 삼엄하다고요

370
00:22:01,254 --> 00:22:03,172
그런데 그들이
이미 범인을 잡았잖나?

371
00:22:03,173 --> 00:22:05,507
- 그렇지 않나?
- 아뇨

372
00:22:05,508 --> 00:22:08,010
- 타이렐 웰릭은 알아요
- 그들이 원하는 것만 알고있지

373
00:22:08,011 --> 00:22:10,095
그는 흔한 기업의 노예야

374
00:22:10,096 --> 00:22:12,481
우리가 유출한 데이터 덕에

375
00:22:12,482 --> 00:22:14,349
이빌 사 전체가 휘청거릴거야

376
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:15,851
게다가 우리는 지원군이 있어

377
00:22:15,852 --> 00:22:17,853
구식의 인종차별주의자

378
00:22:17,854 --> 00:22:19,855
성차별주의자, 전체주의자까지

379
00:22:19,856 --> 00:22:21,773
이렇게 든든한 "주의자"들 덕에

380
00:22:21,825 --> 00:22:23,609
그들은 사태를
제대로 파악하지 못할거야

381
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:25,777
게다가 콜비를 풀어달라
요구한건 가히 천재적이었지

382
00:22:25,778 --> 00:22:28,997
추적망이 분산되서
절대 우리를 찾지 못할거야

383
00:22:28,998 --> 00:22:31,867
트렌턴의 생각이었어

384
00:22:31,868 --> 00:22:34,526
순진해 보일지 몰라도
얼마나 날카로운지

385
00:22:34,527 --> 00:22:36,955
알라신은 참 위대하다니깐

386
00:22:36,956 --> 00:22:38,540
그동안 너는

387
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:41,043
올세이프에서 보안 허가를 받아
코멧 공장을 해킹하는거야

388
00:22:41,044 --> 00:22:45,380
압력을 높이고
가스 송유관을 폭발시켜

389
00:22:45,381 --> 00:22:47,216
스틸 산을 이빌 사의
영혼과 함꼐

390
00:22:47,217 --> 00:22:49,217
저세상으로 날려버리는 거야

391
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:56,641
저들도 이걸 다 알아요?

392
00:22:56,693 --> 00:22:58,559
너한테 처음 말하는거야

393
00:23:01,231 --> 00:23:03,232
근로자들은요?

394
00:23:03,233 --> 00:23:05,478
공장 근처에 있는 사람들..

395
00:23:05,479 --> 00:23:07,108
모두 다 죽는거에요?

396
00:23:07,109 --> 00:23:11,239
미리 알람을 울릴거야
그들은 걱정마

397
00:23:13,576 --> 00:23:15,410
당신은 가스 송유관을
폭파시키는거에요

398
00:23:15,411 --> 00:23:17,579
세상은 위험한 곳이야

399
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,164
악의 무리 때문에
그런것이 아니라

400
00:23:19,165 --> 00:23:21,332
방관하고 아무짓도
안하는 사람들 때문이지

401
00:23:21,384 --> 00:23:22,584
이건 전쟁이라고

402
00:23:22,585 --> 00:23:24,752
몇몇은 죽겠지
어쩔 수 없는 일이야

403
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:28,807
송유관을 폭파시키고 나면

404
00:23:28,808 --> 00:23:31,843
달린의 바이러스가
국가 데이터 센터로 침투할거야

405
00:23:31,895 --> 00:23:34,997
네가 그걸 도와줄거고

406
00:23:35,765 --> 00:23:39,322
중국의 동부 데이터
백업센터도 날려버릴거야

407
00:23:39,323 --> 00:23:41,687
*다크아미가 도와준데

408
00:23:41,688 --> 00:23:44,843
*다크아미라뇨?
('어노니머스'같은 가상의 국제 해킹그룹)

409
00:23:44,844 --> 00:23:46,357
그들은 체계가 없어요
아무나 해킹한다고요

410
00:23:46,409 --> 00:23:48,277
테러리스트, 북한, 이란, 러시아까지

411
00:23:48,278 --> 00:23:49,778
그 말인즉슨
누구 못지 않게

412
00:23:49,779 --> 00:23:53,532
미국 자본주의도
싫어한다는거야

413
00:23:53,533 --> 00:23:56,131
마지막으로,
이것 역시 중요해

414
00:23:56,132 --> 00:23:58,035
스틸 산

415
00:23:58,087 --> 00:24:00,530
해커의 딜레마지

416
00:24:00,531 --> 00:24:05,209
오프라인 데이터를
어떻게 해킹할 수 있는가

417
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,401
전 아무도
죽이지 않을거에요

418
00:24:15,388 --> 00:24:17,536
엘리엇, 대답해봐

419
00:24:17,537 --> 00:24:19,640
자네는 0인가 1인가?

420
00:24:21,277 --> 00:24:22,978
스스로에게 물어보게

421
00:24:22,979 --> 00:24:25,147
자네는 예스인가 노인가?

422
00:24:25,148 --> 00:24:27,982
자네는 행동하겠나, 방관하겠나?

423
00:24:30,987 --> 00:24:35,693
아저씨, 컴퓨터 모니터를
너무 오래 봤나봐요

424
00:24:35,694 --> 00:24:38,077
삶은 그렇게 이분법적으로
나뉘지 않아요

425
00:24:38,078 --> 00:24:39,464
과연 그럴까?

426
00:24:39,465 --> 00:24:41,799
물론 회색지대도 있겠지

427
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,081
하지만 자세히 살펴봐

428
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:48,085
모든 선택의 중심에는
0과 1이 존재해

429
00:24:48,137 --> 00:24:51,256
행동하겠는가
아무것도 하지 않겠는가

430
00:24:51,257 --> 00:24:53,842
저 문을 나가면, 아무것도
하지 않기로 결정한거야

431
00:24:53,843 --> 00:24:57,679
'노'라고 대답하는 거지
넌 떠나는거야

432
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:01,016
그렇게 되면, 넌 더이상
여기에 속하지 않아

433
00:25:01,017 --> 00:25:03,936
넌 0이 되는거야

434
00:25:03,937 --> 00:25:05,948
하지만 여기에 머문다면

435
00:25:05,949 --> 00:25:08,773
세상을 바꾸고 싶다면..

436
00:25:08,825 --> 00:25:10,609
너는 '예스'가 되는거야

437
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:13,778
1이 되는거야

438
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:15,947
그럼 다시 묻겠네

439
00:25:15,999 --> 00:25:19,284
자네는 1인가 0인가?

440
00:25:19,285 --> 00:25:21,452
저 때문에 무고한 남자가
감옥에 갔어요

441
00:25:21,504 --> 00:25:23,739
한두 살 먹은 어린애도
아니고, 왜 그래?

442
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:26,310
콜비랑은 상관 없는 일이잖아!

443
00:25:29,308 --> 00:25:31,546
내 혁명에 관한 것도 아니야

444
00:25:31,547 --> 00:25:33,941
이건 너한테
더 중요한 일이지

445
00:25:33,942 --> 00:25:35,481
이건 저 개자식들 때문에

446
00:25:35,482 --> 00:25:38,000
아버지가 천천히 죽어갈때
자네의 바람에 관한 거야

447
00:25:38,001 --> 00:25:40,389
넌 그가 무언가 하길 바랬어
하지만 그는 그러지 않았지

448
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:42,380
그가 0이었기 때문이야

449
00:25:42,381 --> 00:25:44,426
네가 지금 그러는 것처럼

450
00:25:46,229 --> 00:25:48,229
지랄 마

451
00:25:51,434 --> 00:25:54,268
또 사라지는거야?

452
00:25:56,272 --> 00:25:59,406
난 아무도 안 죽일거야
여기서 나는 빼줘

453
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,861
넌 도망칠 수 없어

454
00:26:03,913 --> 00:26:05,280
네가 있던 없던
우리는 계속할거야

455
00:26:05,281 --> 00:26:07,531
하지만 넌 이미
여기에 가담했다고!

456
00:26:07,583 --> 00:26:10,752
멍청한 네 후드가
퍽이나 널 보호해주겠다!

457
00:26:10,753 --> 00:26:12,287
이건 실수야

458
00:26:12,288 --> 00:26:13,955
그들을 고발해야 해

459
00:26:13,956 --> 00:26:16,291
나도 엮이게 되려나?
젠장, 여자애 말이 맞아

460
00:26:16,292 --> 00:26:18,960
나도 과실이 있어
아니, 우리는 과실이 있어

461
00:26:18,961 --> 00:26:22,096
당신도 나랑 가담했으니
같이 해결책을 생각하자

462
00:26:26,908 --> 00:26:28,908
샤일라?

463
00:26:33,881 --> 00:26:35,631
샤일라, 문 좀 열어줘

464
00:26:36,067 --> 00:26:38,317
어서 와

465
00:26:38,369 --> 00:26:40,903
뭐 도와줄까?

466
00:26:43,374 --> 00:26:46,993
샤일라 좀 보러 왔는데

467
00:26:46,994 --> 00:26:48,911
어머, 그래라

468
00:26:48,963 --> 00:26:50,963
지금 욕조에 있어

469
00:26:55,169 --> 00:26:56,836
샤일라

470
00:26:56,837 --> 00:26:58,837
금방 나올거야

471
00:27:00,742 --> 00:27:03,859
앉아서 기다려도 돼

472
00:27:03,911 --> 00:27:06,779
샤일라가 괜찮은지
확인해야 할 것 같은데

473
00:27:09,334 --> 00:27:13,202
웃기는 놈이네
너 마음에 든다

474
00:27:13,254 --> 00:27:15,372
무례하게 굴지 말라고

475
00:27:15,373 --> 00:27:18,207
앉아서 기다리지

476
00:27:36,027 --> 00:27:38,561
사양할게

477
00:27:41,566 --> 00:27:43,650
너 이것만 하는구나

478
00:27:43,651 --> 00:27:47,570
약하면서 해독제도 같이 쓰는
놈은 너가 처음이다

479
00:27:47,622 --> 00:27:49,822
영리해

480
00:27:49,874 --> 00:27:52,658
네가 중독자가 아니라고
여길 수도 있겠어

481
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:55,379
이런, 병신같은

482
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,681
내 소개를 안했네
나는 페르난...

483
00:27:57,682 --> 00:27:59,683
페르난도 베라
샤일라의 공급자이다

484
00:27:59,684 --> 00:28:01,852
내가 해킹한 놈들 중
가장 최악인 자식이다

485
00:28:01,853 --> 00:28:05,555
녀석의 비밀번호?
"좆이나 빨아 6969"

486
00:28:05,556 --> 00:28:09,159
포르노와 웹캠에
거금을 낭비하는건 물론이거니와

487
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:12,729
이메일, 페이스북, 트위터로
모든 마약거래를 한다

488
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:15,265
경찰이 놈을 아직도
잡지 못하는 것은 이해가 안간다

489
00:28:15,266 --> 00:28:17,033
뇌세포가 하나라도 있으면

490
00:28:17,034 --> 00:28:19,536
갱의 가장 쉬운 코드를
깰수 있을 텐데

491
00:28:19,537 --> 00:28:21,688
그걸 코드라고
부를 수 있다면 말이다

492
00:28:21,689 --> 00:28:25,375
놈의 트위터와 연관된
기사를 찾아보니

493
00:28:25,376 --> 00:28:29,112
나는 과자와 또각이가
총을 의미함을 깨달았다

494
00:28:29,113 --> 00:28:32,082
음식, 조개, 가스는
총알을 의미한다

495
00:28:32,083 --> 00:28:34,885
일찍 꿈나라로 가다

496
00:28:34,886 --> 00:28:37,053
이 궁극적인 표현은
직접적인 연관은 못 찾았지만

497
00:28:37,054 --> 00:28:38,922
총과 총알을 더하면

498
00:28:38,923 --> 00:28:41,057
그 결과가 무엇일지
뻔하지 않겠는가

499
00:28:41,058 --> 00:28:42,592
놈을 고발할까 생각도 해보았지만

500
00:28:42,593 --> 00:28:44,761
그는 샤일라의 유일한 공급책이다

501
00:28:44,762 --> 00:28:47,063
내가 그를 신고하면
나는 내 약들을 잃는다

502
00:28:47,064 --> 00:28:50,400
지금 이 상황에선
난 약 없이는 버틸 수 없다

503
00:28:50,401 --> 00:28:53,069
알아들었지?

504
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:55,238
어쨌던 말야

505
00:28:55,239 --> 00:28:58,442
걱정하지 말라고

506
00:28:58,443 --> 00:29:00,575
너 얘기도 해봐

507
00:29:01,725 --> 00:29:03,446
이름이 뭐야?

508
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:07,149
엘리엇

509
00:29:07,201 --> 00:29:08,985
무슨 의미야?

510
00:29:08,986 --> 00:29:11,822
뭐야 설마
검색도 안해봤어?

511
00:29:11,823 --> 00:29:13,390
꼭 해보라고

512
00:29:13,391 --> 00:29:15,659
이름의 의미는
엄청 중요하다고

513
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:18,928
샤일라는 괜찮아!
신경쓰지 말라니깐!

514
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,734
날 믿어

515
00:29:24,735 --> 00:29:27,411
내가 잘 처리했어

516
00:29:32,243 --> 00:29:34,511
널 보니깐
내가 어렸을 때가 생각나네

517
00:29:34,512 --> 00:29:36,613
항상 우울하고 음침했지

518
00:29:36,614 --> 00:29:40,584
자살 시도도 몇번 했다니깐

519
00:29:40,585 --> 00:29:42,786
근데 매번 실패했어

520
00:29:42,787 --> 00:29:45,414
생물학에 젬병인가봐

521
00:29:46,156 --> 00:29:49,125
내가 너무 싫어
여전히 그래

522
00:29:49,126 --> 00:29:52,828
오랫동안 그게
내 단점이라 생각했지

523
00:29:58,669 --> 00:30:02,439
하지만 지금은
내 강점이라고 생각해

524
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:05,342
사람들은 돌아다녀
혐오가 뭔지 모르는 것처럼

525
00:30:05,343 --> 00:30:09,779
스스로를
혐오하기 전까진 그러겠지

526
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:12,315
내말은..

527
00:30:12,316 --> 00:30:15,184
진심으로 자신을
혐오하는거 말이야

528
00:30:15,819 --> 00:30:17,786
그게 바로 힘이야

529
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:33,277
넌 내가 무섭지 않나봐?

530
00:30:34,906 --> 00:30:36,907
다행이야

531
00:30:36,908 --> 00:30:39,625
너랑 친구 먹는데
시간낭비한게 아니니깐

532
00:30:41,921 --> 00:30:44,030
이거 안필요하지 그치?

533
00:30:44,082 --> 00:30:48,618
너같이 용기있는 사람은
해독약 없이도 견딜 수 있어

534
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:52,783
사실 네 덕에 오늘
내가 샤일라를 만났거든

535
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:56,293
모든 걸 취급하는 새끼는
나뿐이니깐

536
00:30:56,294 --> 00:30:58,762
너의 귀중한 섭옥손까지
포함해서 말이야

537
00:30:58,763 --> 00:31:01,863
한편으론 너한테
고맙다고 해야겠는걸

538
00:31:01,864 --> 00:31:04,268
네가 날 그녀에게
데려온거니깐 말야

539
00:31:04,269 --> 00:31:07,219
너의 별은 나와 함께
궤도를 돌고있다고

540
00:31:07,272 --> 00:31:10,896
내 삶의 사랑을
가져다주면서 말이지

541
00:31:10,897 --> 00:31:14,212
이거, 우리가
여기에 있는거?

542
00:31:14,213 --> 00:31:16,729
그건 모두..

543
00:31:16,781 --> 00:31:19,232
아름다운 의미를
지니고 있는거야

544
00:31:19,233 --> 00:31:20,956
하지만 착각하지 말라고

545
00:31:20,957 --> 00:31:24,270
저 안에 있는 여자는
내 꺼야

546
00:31:25,256 --> 00:31:27,924
샤일라 없이는
어떻게 살지 모르겠어

547
00:31:27,925 --> 00:31:31,757
네가 그녀와 무슨
관계인지는 모르지만

548
00:31:31,758 --> 00:31:35,827
우리는 이제 친구니깐..

549
00:31:35,828 --> 00:31:38,935
이 경계를 지켜주길 바랄게

550
00:31:38,936 --> 00:31:40,936
우리 통한거지?

551
00:31:50,898 --> 00:31:53,767
오늘 아침에 만난 자식도
너랑 똑같이 쳐다보더라

552
00:31:53,768 --> 00:31:55,936
내가 말하고 싶은건

553
00:31:55,937 --> 00:31:58,654
무서워하는게 때로는
더 현명할 수도 있단거야

554
00:32:00,825 --> 00:32:02,825
어쩌면 멍청할수도 있고

555
00:32:08,499 --> 00:32:09,866
샤일라?

556
00:32:09,867 --> 00:32:11,335
자물쇠 따기

557
00:32:11,336 --> 00:32:12,919
해커들이 가장 좋아하는 스포츠다

558
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,338
뚫기에 가장 완벽한 시스템이자

559
00:32:14,339 --> 00:32:16,288
가상현실과는 다르게

560
00:32:16,341 --> 00:32:18,207
자물쇠를 따면
직접 느낄 수 있기 때문이다

561
00:32:18,259 --> 00:32:19,675
직접 볼 수 있고
들을 수 있다

562
00:32:26,134 --> 00:32:27,954
샤일라

563
00:32:32,403 --> 00:32:35,338
샤일라, 정신차려

564
00:32:38,529 --> 00:32:41,148
무슨 일이야?

565
00:32:41,149 --> 00:32:44,234
괜찮아?

566
00:32:44,235 --> 00:32:46,403
왜 깡패놈이
너네집에 있는거야?

567
00:32:46,404 --> 00:32:48,237
나 왜 욕조에 있지?

568
00:32:52,619 --> 00:32:55,944
기억이 안나...
네 약이 필요하다고 말했어

569
00:32:55,945 --> 00:32:59,300
걔가 우리집에 왔고
약을 같이 했어

570
00:33:00,727 --> 00:33:02,461
놈이랑 섹스한건 기억나?

571
00:33:02,462 --> 00:33:05,531
뭐? 아니

572
00:33:05,532 --> 00:33:07,500
하지만 그는 분명히 했다

573
00:33:07,501 --> 00:33:08,834
알겠어, 가자

574
00:33:08,835 --> 00:33:10,903
- 지갑 챙겨, 신분증이랑..
- 그만 해

575
00:33:10,904 --> 00:33:14,507
난 어디도 안가

576
00:33:14,508 --> 00:33:15,975
무슨 말이야?

577
00:33:15,976 --> 00:33:18,076
놈이 이대로 관둘것 같아?

578
00:33:19,526 --> 00:33:21,948
걔한테 다시 돌아가면 안돼
나 약 없어도 돼

579
00:33:21,949 --> 00:33:24,950
- 다른 사람 찾으면 되잖아
- 그럴 수 없어

580
00:33:28,789 --> 00:33:32,692
베라가 정말 후하게
챙겨준단 말이야

581
00:33:32,693 --> 00:33:34,527
나 돈도 꽤 많이 벌어

582
00:33:34,528 --> 00:33:36,329
또 시작이다

583
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:38,331
우리를 지배하는
보이지 않는 손

584
00:33:38,332 --> 00:33:41,334
고통의 한계점을 지나도
따를 수밖에 없게 만든다

585
00:33:41,335 --> 00:33:44,537
이번이 끝이 아닐거야

586
00:33:44,538 --> 00:33:46,505
놈이 또 그러면?

587
00:33:46,506 --> 00:33:49,849
가만히 있는다고
약속해줄래?

588
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:52,111
나 진지해, 엘리엇

589
00:33:52,112 --> 00:33:55,114
내가 할 수 있는 건
아무것도 없는 걸

590
00:33:55,115 --> 00:33:57,382
난 선택권이 없어

591
00:33:59,219 --> 00:34:00,553
엘리엇

592
00:34:00,554 --> 00:34:03,455
오늘 밤
내 옆에 있어줄래?

593
00:34:08,061 --> 00:34:09,862
선택

594
00:34:09,863 --> 00:34:12,131
미스터 로봇이 맞을지도 모른다

595
00:34:12,132 --> 00:34:16,202
모든게 삶의
예스와 노에 대한 것이다

596
00:34:16,203 --> 00:34:19,905
우리가 그것을 결정하는가
그것이 우리를 결정하는가?

597
00:34:19,906 --> 00:34:22,241
페르난도 베라
나는 그를 없앨 것이다

598
00:34:22,242 --> 00:34:24,410
내 마약 공급책을 없앨 것이다

599
00:34:24,411 --> 00:34:26,212
나는 모르핀을 없앨 것이다

600
00:34:26,213 --> 00:34:29,255
내 안의 고통이 욱씬거린다

601
00:34:29,256 --> 00:34:31,484
다른 공급책은
얼마든지 찾을 수 있다

602
00:34:31,485 --> 00:34:34,553
하지만 베라가 말했듯
어떤 놈도 섭옥손을 취급하진 않는다

603
00:34:34,554 --> 00:34:36,989
디지털로 처방전을
위조하면 되지만

604
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:39,992
약국들은 이런 걸 막기위해
엄청난 돈을 쓴다

605
00:34:39,993 --> 00:34:42,327
대부분이 종이 처방전만 받는다

606
00:34:42,379 --> 00:34:44,830
계속 합법적으로
약을 받는건 비현실적이다

607
00:34:44,831 --> 00:34:46,882
중독자가 되는 것 또한 그렇다

608
00:34:46,883 --> 00:34:49,031
마약 치료제를 끊거나

609
00:34:49,032 --> 00:34:51,141
베라를 계속 보거나
둘 중 하나인거다

610
00:34:51,142 --> 00:34:53,889
당신이 무슨 생각하는지 안다
답이 너무 뻔하지

611
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:56,341
베라는 샤일라와 잘 수는 있지만

612
00:34:56,342 --> 00:34:58,471
강간은 용납할 수 없다

613
00:35:01,932 --> 00:35:05,518
샤일라처럼, 그는
내게 선택의 여지를 주지 않는군

614
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:08,520
그는 더이상 존재해서는 안된다

615
00:35:20,534 --> 00:35:24,536
지금 어떤 기분인지부터 말해봐요

616
00:35:27,734 --> 00:35:30,449
안 좋아요

617
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:33,584
뭐가 안좋죠?

618
00:35:34,396 --> 00:35:35,880
모든게 다요

619
00:35:37,884 --> 00:35:40,769
더 자세히 말해주실래요?

620
00:35:45,152 --> 00:35:49,125
모든걸 통제하고 있는지
어떻게 알수 있죠?

621
00:35:50,503 --> 00:35:52,779
우리가 처한 상황에서

622
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:55,259
최선의 선택지를
고르지 않으면

623
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:57,174
그걸로 끝인거에요

624
00:35:57,175 --> 00:36:01,407
두가지 선택지 사이에
계속해서 고민하죠

625
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:05,327
대기실에 걸린
두 폭의 그림처럼요

626
00:36:05,328 --> 00:36:08,773
코카콜라인가, 펩시인가

627
00:36:09,431 --> 00:36:12,918
맥도날드인가, 버거킹인가

628
00:36:12,919 --> 00:36:16,751
현대인가, 혼다인가

629
00:36:20,631 --> 00:36:24,938
참 경계가 모호해요
그렇지 않나요?

630
00:36:24,939 --> 00:36:27,991
초점에서 벗어나 보면

631
00:36:27,992 --> 00:36:31,003
모두 선택의 허상인거에요

632
00:36:31,004 --> 00:36:34,206
대다수 사람들는 자신의 케이블이나

633
00:36:34,207 --> 00:36:37,610
가스, 전기회사조차 못 고르죠

634
00:36:37,611 --> 00:36:41,591
어떤 물을 마실지
어떤 보험에 가입할지도요

635
00:36:41,592 --> 00:36:45,284
우리가 선택할 수 있다한들
그게 무슨 소용이 있나요?

636
00:36:45,285 --> 00:36:48,330
선택지가
블루크로스와 블루실드라면

637
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:51,005
빌어먹을, 무슨 의미가 있죠?

638
00:36:55,953 --> 00:37:00,305
그들은 결과적으로
똑같지 않나요?

639
00:37:01,134 --> 00:37:03,018
아뇨

640
00:37:03,019 --> 00:37:06,851
우리의 선택은
이미 예전부터

641
00:37:06,852 --> 00:37:10,207
결정이 되어있는 거에요

642
00:37:10,208 --> 00:37:13,478
엘리엇 씨가 무기력하게
느낀다니 유감이에요

643
00:37:15,482 --> 00:37:19,329
저는 제가 좋은 일을
하는 줄 알았어요

644
00:37:20,775 --> 00:37:24,325
저는 한 프로젝트의...
멤버였죠

645
00:37:25,249 --> 00:37:29,327
무언가 의미있는 일을
한다고 생각했거든요

646
00:37:33,917 --> 00:37:38,670
- 지금은 어떠신데요?
- 지금은..

647
00:37:38,671 --> 00:37:41,340
모든 게 다
실수라고 생각해요

648
00:37:41,341 --> 00:37:43,759
다른 모든 것처럼요

649
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,604
무슨 의미가 있겠어요

650
00:37:48,512 --> 00:37:52,017
당신은 아무것도
안하는 게 차라리 나아요

651
00:37:52,018 --> 00:37:55,440
아무것도 안하는게
차라리 나아요

652
00:37:55,441 --> 00:37:57,690
전에도 이 문제를 얘기했어요

653
00:37:57,691 --> 00:38:00,693
엘리엇씨가 아무것도 할 수
없다는 느낌이 든다는 문제요

654
00:38:00,694 --> 00:38:02,694
기억하세요?

655
00:38:05,582 --> 00:38:08,367
엘리엇씨 아버님에 대해
얘기했을 때에요

656
00:38:08,368 --> 00:38:10,869
아버지가 암에 걸렸을 때

657
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:13,539
아무것도 안하기로
결정한 걸 얘기했죠

658
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:15,124
엘리엇 씨는 아버지께

659
00:38:15,125 --> 00:38:16,709
병을 유발시킨 회사와
싸워야 한다고 말했어요

660
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:18,544
아버지도 사람들에게
알렸을 수도 있어요

661
00:38:18,545 --> 00:38:22,214
더 좋은 치료를
받을 수도 있었겠죠

662
00:38:22,215 --> 00:38:25,768
하지만 엘리엇씨 아버지는
아무것도 안하셨죠

663
00:38:25,769 --> 00:38:28,783
어쩌면 아버님이
지금 엘리엇씨가 느끼는 것과

664
00:38:28,784 --> 00:38:31,183
똑같은 감정을
느끼셨을지 몰라요

665
00:38:31,184 --> 00:38:34,058
그래봤자, 누구 말마따나
이게 다 무슨 소용이죠?

666
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:36,312
- 그건 달라요
- 여기서 다른점은

667
00:38:36,313 --> 00:38:39,231
엘리엇, 당신은
선택의 여지가 있다는 거에요

668
00:38:39,232 --> 00:38:41,170
그게 당신이 가진 힘이에요

669
00:38:41,171 --> 00:38:43,126
당신은 통제할 수 있어요

670
00:38:43,127 --> 00:38:46,913
삶이 당신을 이끄는대로
끌려가지 않아도 돼요

671
00:38:46,914 --> 00:38:48,740
말해봐요

672
00:38:48,741 --> 00:38:51,660
도대체 무슨 일인거죠?

673
00:38:51,661 --> 00:38:54,245
저한테 계속 숨기면
당신을 도와줄 수 없어요

674
00:38:54,246 --> 00:38:55,797
닥쳐요!

675
00:38:58,835 --> 00:39:00,335
시끄러워!

676
00:39:03,146 --> 00:39:05,090
눈이 피곤에 찌들었네요

677
00:39:05,091 --> 00:39:06,925
소리치고 있고요
신경과민이에요

678
00:39:06,926 --> 00:39:09,011
지난 몇달 동안 엘리엇씨가

679
00:39:09,012 --> 00:39:14,350
다시 예전 습관으로
되돌아가는걸 지켜봐왔어요

680
00:39:14,351 --> 00:39:17,349
도 대 체
무슨 일이냐고요!

681
00:40:16,212 --> 00:40:17,996
여전히 전화 안받네

682
00:40:17,997 --> 00:40:22,333
엘리엇한테 내일
물어보면 되잖아

683
00:40:22,385 --> 00:40:24,586
매번 이걸 재생하려고 하면

684
00:40:24,587 --> 00:40:28,006
컴퓨터가 멈추고
CD를 뱉어내

685
00:40:28,007 --> 00:40:31,093
걔 요즘 상태가 안좋아

686
00:40:31,094 --> 00:40:34,178
오늘 완전 딴사람 같았다고

687
00:40:39,176 --> 00:40:42,455
오늘 밤 어때?
-스텔라-

688
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:46,488
알겠어. 이따 전화할게
자기야 뭐라고 말했어?

689
00:40:46,489 --> 00:40:48,193
알겠어. 이따 전화할게
뭔가 잘못됐다고

690
00:40:48,194 --> 00:40:49,778
걔네집에 가볼까?

691
00:40:51,763 --> 00:40:54,199
괜찮은지 얼굴 좀 보게

692
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,685
자기야, 걱정하지마

693
00:40:59,539 --> 00:41:01,123
엘리엇은 항상
이상하게 굴었잖아

694
00:41:01,124 --> 00:41:05,429
걱정된단 말이야

695
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:07,666
그런데 말야

696
00:41:07,667 --> 00:41:10,261
애리조나 친구
프레드 기억나?

697
00:41:10,262 --> 00:41:13,385
한잔 하자는데

698
00:41:13,386 --> 00:41:15,636
금방 올게

699
00:41:16,697 --> 00:41:18,272
알겠어

700
00:42:01,022 --> 00:42:03,302
성공했습니다

701
00:42:29,865 --> 00:42:32,854
뜨거운 열정과 갈망

702
00:42:32,855 --> 00:42:35,652
두 사람은 그렇게 강렬한 사랑..

703
00:42:35,704 --> 00:42:40,073
가까움, 연결된 기분을
느껴본 적이 없었다

704
00:42:40,625 --> 00:42:43,210
- 다른 방법은 찾으셨...
- 조용!

705
00:42:43,211 --> 00:42:45,211
여기 앉게

706
00:42:54,789 --> 00:42:58,107
송유관을 폭파하지 않고
해킹할 수 있어요

707
00:42:58,108 --> 00:43:00,845
엘리엇, 우리 아직
화해 안 했어

708
00:43:00,846 --> 00:43:02,958
문을 박차고 나간거 기억안나?

709
00:43:02,959 --> 00:43:04,171
그랬죠

710
00:43:04,172 --> 00:43:06,066
내가 말했을텐데
문을 나가는 순간부터

711
00:43:06,067 --> 00:43:08,786
넌 더이상 우리 멤버가
아니라고 말이야

712
00:43:08,787 --> 00:43:11,021
저한테 계획이 있어요

713
00:43:11,022 --> 00:43:13,257
널 지지해주길 바라면

714
00:43:13,258 --> 00:43:16,093
넌 나한테 빚을 지는거야

715
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:18,012
왜냐면 넌 그냥 떠났거든

716
00:43:18,013 --> 00:43:19,962
빚 같은 거
안 믿는 줄 알았는데요

717
00:43:19,963 --> 00:43:22,015
아니, 난 빚을 믿어

718
00:43:22,067 --> 00:43:24,434
빚을 없애야 한다고 믿지

719
00:43:28,437 --> 00:43:30,633
제가 어떻게 하길 바래요?

720
00:43:33,195 --> 00:43:36,030
네 아버지에 대해 말해줘

721
00:43:36,031 --> 00:43:38,282
당신은 제 머릿속으로
들어올 수 없어요

722
00:43:38,283 --> 00:43:40,744
당신의 사이비 연설은
안먹힌다고요

723
00:43:40,745 --> 00:43:42,535
그가 어떻게 죽었는지 말해봐

724
00:43:42,587 --> 00:43:44,037
왜요?

725
00:43:44,089 --> 00:43:46,206
당신은 이미 답을
알고 있는 것 같은데요

726
00:43:46,258 --> 00:43:48,675
자네한테서 직접 듣고싶네

727
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,134
제가 이걸 하면...

728
00:43:57,135 --> 00:43:58,836
우리는 은신처로 돌아가

729
00:43:58,837 --> 00:44:01,054
계획에 대해 얘기하는거죠?

730
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:18,525
아저씨가 무슨 얘길 듣고
싶은건지 모르겠네요

731
00:44:18,526 --> 00:44:20,632
아빠랑 저는 엄청 친했어요

732
00:44:20,633 --> 00:44:22,942
제 가장 친한 친구셨죠

733
00:44:22,997 --> 00:44:26,780
아버지는 이빌 사에
평생을 바쳐 일하셨고

734
00:44:26,781 --> 00:44:29,795
거기서 가장 뛰어난
컴퓨터 엔지니어였죠

735
00:44:29,796 --> 00:44:32,170
어느날 갑자기
아버지가 해고당했어요

736
00:44:32,171 --> 00:44:34,287
아무도 이유를 몰랐죠

737
00:44:34,288 --> 00:44:37,274
어느날 말씀해 주시더군요

738
00:44:37,275 --> 00:44:39,843
백혈병이 있다고요

739
00:44:39,844 --> 00:44:42,111
아무한테도 말하지
말라고 하셨어요

740
00:44:42,112 --> 00:44:44,779
특히 저희 엄마한테요

741
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:46,449
그래서 전 입을 닫고 있었죠

742
00:44:46,501 --> 00:44:48,617
몇 달이 지났고

743
00:44:48,618 --> 00:44:51,204
아버지 병세가 악화됐어요

744
00:44:51,205 --> 00:44:55,291
계속 걱정하다가

745
00:44:55,292 --> 00:44:57,460
결국 엄마한테 털어놨어요

746
00:44:57,512 --> 00:45:00,270
아버지는 엄청 화를 내셨죠

747
00:45:00,271 --> 00:45:02,715
고래 고래 소리지르셨어요

748
00:45:02,767 --> 00:45:06,733
아빠를 껴안고
죄송하다 하려 했지만

749
00:45:06,734 --> 00:45:09,440
아빠는 계속 저를 밀어냈어요

750
00:45:09,441 --> 00:45:11,693
너무나 세게 밀친 나머지
저는 창밖으로 떨어졌죠

751
00:45:11,694 --> 00:45:14,894
떨어지면서 팔이 부러졌어요

752
00:45:14,946 --> 00:45:17,531
아버지는 이후에
저랑 한마디도 안하셨죠

753
00:45:17,532 --> 00:45:19,615
저를 쳐다보지도 않았어요

754
00:45:19,616 --> 00:45:22,285
아빠가 돌아가신 날조차도요

755
00:45:25,379 --> 00:45:27,192
이제 됐죠?

756
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:44,891
부모를 잃는 기분이
어떤 기분인지 아네

757
00:45:44,943 --> 00:45:47,143
가슴이 찢어지지

758
00:45:50,148 --> 00:45:54,318
자넨 아버지가
옳았다고 생각하나?

759
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:56,153
뭐가요?

760
00:45:56,154 --> 00:45:58,592
자넬 상처준거 말이야

761
00:45:58,593 --> 00:46:00,657
네가 엄마한테
말했다는 이유만으로

762
00:46:00,658 --> 00:46:02,364
그 처벌이 가혹하다고
생각하진 않았나?

763
00:46:02,365 --> 00:46:04,244
저는 아무것도
하지 않았어요

764
00:46:04,245 --> 00:46:06,079
그저 아빠를
돕고 싶었을 뿐이에요

765
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:07,683
그의 신뢰를
배반하면서 말이지

766
00:46:07,684 --> 00:46:09,882
저는 8살이었...

767
00:46:15,139 --> 00:46:18,642
자넨 신성한 약속을 져버린거야

768
00:46:27,455 --> 00:46:31,738
자막 제작: 기미갤 12:51
Don't take anything for granted.

769
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,430
What I'm about to tell you is top secret,

770
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,090
Evil Corp.

771
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:07,130
Tyrell Wellick.

772
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:08,610
You want to do these together then?

773
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:09,780
Pure Molly...

774
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:10,750
No, Shayla.

775
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:12,360
I need you to come to AllSafe.

776
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,620
Shit. They're in the network?

777
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,600
This is it. Fsociety.

778
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,380
They're telling me to leave it here.

779
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:20,200
Who are you?

780
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,410
I think you should come with me.

781
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,020
Yeah, that's Darlene.

782
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,060
You are going to modify the dat file

783
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:26,540
put Colby's IP in there.

784
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:27,400
You do that,

785
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:31,120
you have set in motion the largest revolution the
world will ever see.

786
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,610
sources have confirmed the hacks were

787
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:37,870
in part tied to Colby's terminal.

788
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:39,670
Sir, step inside the car.

789
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:47,570
Bon soir, Elliot.

790
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:13,950
"Give a man a gun and he can rob a bank,

791
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,630
but give a man a bank, and he can rob the world."

792
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:19,950
It's a bit of a silly expression, actually.

793
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:23,000
A little reductive, but still...

794
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:24,440
I like it,

795
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,480
for the same reason most people hate it,

796
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,840
because to me it means that

797
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,370
power belongs to the people that take it.

798
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:34,550
Nothing to do with their hard work, strong
ambitions,

799
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:36,790
or rightful qualifications, no.

800
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:42,500
The actual will to take is often the only thing
that's necessary.

801
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:46,030
I'm sorry to bring you in like this.

802
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,130
Technically what we're doing might be considered
illegal,

803
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,820
which is why I'm surrounded

804
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,960
by eleven of our most annoying lawyers.

805
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:58,120
Elliot Alderson...

806
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,570
I want to offer you

807
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:06,340
a position here at Evil Corp.

808
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,730
I want you to head our cybersecurity division.

809
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,030
Except I can't officially offer you anything

810
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,430
since we have this non-compete with your employer,
Allsafe.

811
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,790
But if you do this of your own accord--

812
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,450
when you do this--

813
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:26,380
you'll be a multi-millionaire within the next five
years.

814
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,560
What do you say?

815
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,470
Can I--

816
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:43,190
Can I think about it?

817
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,510
Gentlemen, I need the room.

818
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,040
Yes, thank you. Yes, yes.

819
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:13,790
You know,

820
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:18,790
Evil Corp has just named me interim CTO.

821
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,620
It won't be long until it's official.

822
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:26,030
I will be the youngest executive this company has
ever seen.

823
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:29,400
I should track down these hackers out there

824
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,820
just to thank them.

825
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,430
In a way, it's kind of, um...

826
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,240
What's the word in English?

827
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,440
Serendipitous? Right?

828
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,930
You know, by the end of the quarter,

829
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,400
we're going to revamp our entire network

830
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,890
and consolidate our security protocols.

831
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:06,050
We're going to handle everything internally,

832
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:10,150
which means all of our vendors, including Allsafe,

833
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,640
will be cut loose.

834
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,280
And it's no secret that once Allsafe loses us as a
client,

835
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,480
they'll be fini.

836
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,750
And when that happens,

837
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:21,090
I want you to be where you belong:

838
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:22,840
here with me.

839
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,580
This is an important choice you're making, Elliot.

840
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,490
I just wanted you to know all the facts

841
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:31,620
before you made your final decision.

842
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:46,390
I think I'm happy where I am.

843
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:13,690
Well, I thought I'd ask.

844
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,530
Call this number if you need to get in touch with
Mr. Wellick.

845
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:01,180
You can call me Mr. X.

846
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,190
Come on, you've never seen JFK?

847
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:09,530
Oliver Stone movie?

848
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,040
Sir, I gotta be honest. That's embarrassing.

849
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,480
Do yourself a favor and watch it.

850
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:16,950
And pay, for Christ's sake.

851
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,080
Anyway, you can call me Mr. Sutherland for now.

852
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,290
Don't hesitate to reach me when you're ready.

853
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,870
We're always close by.

854
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,980
I'm gonna set a date right now--

855
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,010
- No, we're not. - For later.

856
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:40,390
I gotta go, thank you very much.

857
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,840
- You gonna have me up? - No.

858
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:44,440
- Gonna have me up? - No, stop.

859
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,930
- I'm coming up. - No, you're not coming up.

860
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,490
Another time. Okay, I gotta go.

861
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,470
Come on.

862
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:57,370
- Everything all right? - Yeah, he's just a
creeper.

863
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,880
I hate it when your employers can't take a hint.

864
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:07,370
Hey, is your radiator messed up?

865
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:10,000
Because it's like 3,000 degrees in my apartment.

866
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:15,240
Hey, are you okay? You seem off.

867
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,670
While we're here, you mind if I reup?

868
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,990
A little early to reup, don't you think?

869
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,710
I'm deviating from the schedule a little.

870
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:27,760
Whoa, never thought I'd see the day, Mr. Stricty
Pants,

871
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,730
but okie dokie.

872
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,390
Oh, yeah. Shit, I'm out of the other ones.

873
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:35,720
No, just the morphine. It's good.

874
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:38,630
Uh, no, you made me promise never to give you
these

875
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,030
unless I had your Subs.

876
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,660
- Shayla. - No, Elliot.

877
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,490
Promises matter, okay?

878
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:47,620
I take this shit to heart.

879
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,820
Oh, my God.

880
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,890
Fine, but you have to promise me you won't do a
lot

881
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,600
until I get your withdrawal meds, okay?

882
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,610
I'll go see Fernando later or something.

883
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:03,570
No, you have to say it.

884
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:08,400
I promise.

885
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:20,040
Hey, man.

886
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:23,110
What, you think I forgot about you?

887
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:25,210
Trust me, I need you now more than ever.

888
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,830
We gotta get to work.

889
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,460
Hacking Tyrell Wellick, you'd think it'd be
tricky,

890
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,960
but it wasn't--Evil Corp's corporate mail servers,

891
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,220
they haven't patched anything since Shellshock.

892
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,040
He doesn't even use two-step verification.

893
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,830
His password was just his wife's maiden name

894
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:44,520
and Sweden's independence date, 6-6.

895
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,930
One six away from the obvious, but still,

896
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:48,890
this is bad noob practice.

897
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,900
These emails...

898
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:00,960
His life... it's nice, happy, perfect.

899
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,540
This doesn't make sense.

900
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,070
Did he know I was going to hack him?

901
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,220
Did he let me?

902
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,480
I'm gonna need to wipe everything.

903
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,370
I know, I know, taking more than I should.

904
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:16,060
I'm breaking my rule, but come on, it's an off
week.

905
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,340
Come on.

906
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,610
My man, you gotta--

907
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:04,600
You gotta deuce it out over here, all right?

908
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,390
Yo, you gotta do your business up in here, all
right?

909
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:17,840
You got this. You got this.

910
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,000
Terry Colby, the chief technology officer of--

911
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,480
Terry Colby's arrest is on everyone's mind.

912
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:53,540
Screen. Might as well be the same thing nowadays.

913
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,650
How do I go back to work after this?

914
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,520
How can I focus on anything?

915
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:02,070
And when's Mr. Robot going to contact me again?

916
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:03,420
What's he waiting for?

917
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:06,960
Did I just destroy a man's life for no reason?

918
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,890
I'm gonna talk to HR about a salary bump for you.

919
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:11,480
- Oh, please. - No, no.

920
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,520
Take the raise.

921
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:16,240
It's not gonna be much, but it's the best I can do
right now.

922
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:18,510
Elliot...

923
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:20,460
You saved the company.

924
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:25,150
Now...

925
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,350
Why didn't you tell me about the dat file?

926
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,900
You could've come in here at any time before the
meeting

927
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,770
to say you found something, but you didn't.

928
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,950
I gotta be honest. I found that kind of curious.

929
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:44,700
Yeah, I didn't know what I had.

930
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:48,440
Could've easily been a junk file.

931
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,430
C'mon...

932
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,870
You're never sure about anything

933
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,170
unless there's something to be sure about.

934
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,060
Maybe you don't know me that well.

935
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,160
Regardless,

936
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,700
I still need you to stay on it, now more than
ever.

937
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:09,100
I mean, who knows what these fsociety hackers are
going to do next.

938
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:09,980
What did he just say?

939
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:12,710
- What did you just say? - The ones working with
Colby.

940
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,220
Who knows how deep these data dumps are going to
get,

941
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,430
and Evil Corp is--

942
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:18,840
What're you talking about?

943
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,140
There's a twist.

944
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,010
You're usually the one a step ahead of me.

945
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:26,170
They hit the mother lode during the breach.

946
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:29,480
Potentially terabytes worth of emails and files.

947
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,320
They're threatening to dump everything

948
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,550
unless the FBI frees Colby.

949
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,480
They released the video this morning.

950
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:47,060
Hello, Evil Corp. We are fsociety.

951
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:49,190
Over the years, we have been watching you.

952
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:51,160
Your financial abuse of the poor;

953
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,100
your corruption of governments;

954
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,080
your cover-ups of the murder of innocent, ordinary
citizens,

955
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,100
all for the sake of a profit.

956
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,960
This is why we at fsociety have decided you must
die.

957
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:05,950
We are malicious and hostile. We do not
compromise.

958
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:07,610
We are relentless.

959
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,620
We will not stop until every tentacle

960
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:13,630
of your evil monstrosity is sliced off at the
nerve.

961
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:16,010
But we are also not without mercy.

962
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:18,670
Our latest hack was our last warning.

963
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:22,410
Meet our demands, and we will consider not
destroying you.

964
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:24,920
First, release our leader Terry Colby

965
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,230
from your illegitimate prison immediately.

966
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:30,460
Second, release all the people of the world

967
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:33,820
from your even more illegitimate prisons of debt.

968
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,440
Third, dissolve your corporation

969
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:40,320
and donate all your assets to charities around the
world.

970
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:42,630
This proposal is non-negotiable.

971
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:45,300
The people are realizing they don't have freedom
of choice

972
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,830
so long as you exist.

973
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:48,640
The people are waking up,

974
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:51,550
no longer accepting your economic slavery.

975
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:55,460
Meet these demands, or we will kill you.

976
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,360
Consider yourself warned.

977
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:03,400
Play it again.

978
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,710
Yo, yo, yo, yo, my album just dropped.

979
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,470
Yo, please buy my CD. Only cost you 20 likes.

980
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,100
Yo, it'll give you the feels, y'all, I swear.

981
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,220
The CD's free. All's I ask is you Tweet.

982
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,480
Help my social media outreach.

983
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:17,910
You know, be like, "I want to set up this meeting.

984
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,450
It's like a very, like a--"

985
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:20,710
Oh, Elliot!

986
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:22,110
Hey, congrats, man.

987
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,790
Allsafe is all over the internet today because of
you.

988
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:27,430
Dude, we should celebrate. We have this Groupon

989
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:29,570
for four at Morton's on Thursday.

990
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:31,760
This other couple we were going with totally
bailed.

991
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,850
Why don't you come with?

992
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:34,910
Their steaks are badass. It's $29.95--

993
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,390
I'm not sure that Elliot would like that.

994
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,530
Yeah, okay.

995
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,030
Yeah? Okay. Awesome, man.

996
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:42,590
And, hey, why don't we make it a double date?

997
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,070
I heard that you had a girlfriend.

998
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,410
Ollie, you weren't supposed to say anything.

999
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:47,870
Babe, it's cool. Elliot's okay with it.

1000
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:50,160
Yeah, okay, sure. I--have to go.

1001
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,660
Um, my neighbor's complaining about the dog
barking again.

1002
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,690
Since when does he have a dog?

1003
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:03,790
You look like a beautiful couple.

1004
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,200
Yo, my album just dropped,

1005
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,730
You like rap, hip-hop?

1006
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,600
Yo, this shit is deep, lyrical, poetic.

1007
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,390
Yo, your girl will like this, my man, I swear.

1008
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:12,510
Come on, bro, you've been outside our building for
two weeks now.

1009
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:14,230
All right, you know, I'll take it,

1010
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,560
if you leave us alone.

1011
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,390
Thank you, thank you, man, thank you.

1012
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:19,720
And I'll tweet, but only if I like it, all right?

1013
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,540
I only have 48 followers, but it's growing.

1014
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,900
- No doubt, no doubt. - Some tastemakers in there
so--

1015
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,330
I feel you, I feel you.

1016
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,130
- Yeah. - All right.

1017
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:26,860
Yo, I appreciate it, man, really.

1018
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:27,940
- You guys have a good day. - Yeah, you too.

1019
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,630
Thank you so much. Check track two out.

1020
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,500
- Track two. - All right, man.

1021
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,010
This was never part of the plan.

1022
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:36,210
Data dumps? Releasing Terry Colby?

1023
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:37,830
None of this makes sense.

1024
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,520
Need to cut off all ties with fsociety.

1025
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,190
Need to disconnect.

1026
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,210
We need to call in sick and lie low for a--

1027
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:02,820
Dude! Jesus Christ! I am naked, asshole!

1028
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,680
Don't stare at me!

1029
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:06,480
Why the hell are you in my shower?

1030
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,470
Well, I was waiting for you.

1031
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:09,720
You were supposed to come last night.

1032
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,300
- Did you forget? - Come? Where?

1033
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,500
It's fine, everyone's coming later.

1034
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:22,730
I'm stealing your clothes.

1035
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:25,450
My dress has cum stains on it.

1036
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:31,290
Jesus, I am just messing with you.

1037
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:32,560
My stuff is just in the wash.

1038
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,400
I'm gonna borrow this for the time being.

1039
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,290
Oh, by the way,

1040
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,430
your dog shat on your bed.

1041
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:41,830
You gotta walk that thing.

1042
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,770
Hey, please take Flipper for a while.

1043
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:48,400
She probably needs a walk or something.

1044
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,120
She keeps shitting everywhere.

1045
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,290
Of course she needs a walk, Elliot.

1046
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:52,530
She's a friggin' dog.

1047
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:55,520
Yo, I want to stop and get some froyo before we
go.

1048
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:00,080
Uh, I'll be back later.

1049
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,740
- I owe you. - Yeah, big time.

1050
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:17,090
How do you know where I live?

1051
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:19,140
Why wouldn't I know where you live?

1052
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,210
I don't know. I don't know where you live.

1053
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,250
I don't live anywhere at the present.

1054
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:34,490
The douche I was dating proposed to me, can you
believe?

1055
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:36,720
I mean, what an asshole.

1056
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,750
Anyways, we got into this huge fight, and--

1057
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:41,900
What the hell am I doing?

1058
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:44,530
This chick is out of her mind batshit crazy.

1059
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:46,540
I gotta go back, tell Gideon everything.

1060
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,860
He'll understand, right?

1061
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,250
He'll know what to do.

1062
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,710
It's whatevs. He'll take me back.

1063
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:52,990
He's just gotta get over this whole

1064
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:55,340
"Love is forever" bullshit.

1065
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,730
I'll do my disappearing act for a minute,

1066
00:18:57,730 --> 00:18:59,720
and then he'll come to his senses.

1067
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,940
- Stand clear of the closing door. - You know,
it's our thing.

1068
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,260
Quick!

1069
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:16,330
Can she see them, too?

1070
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:17,450
What?

1071
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:19,400
I like to stay on my toes.

1072
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:25,550
Speaking of, that's, like, one of the most
annoying things--

1073
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:28,110
But what if Tyrell finds out? What will he do?

1074
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:31,580
Shit, there's basically no scenario in which

1075
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,610
I'm not getting killed or going to jail.

1076
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:38,020
Because I wanted a turtle, and he was like, "No--"

1077
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:40,210
I might need to crash with you for a couple of
nights.

1078
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:41,730
That's cool, right?

1079
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:43,880
Seriously?

1080
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:46,560
Fine! I'll crash at Mobley's.

1081
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:48,710
Don't love dogs anyway.

1082
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:50,710
Especially ones that shit in your bed.

1083
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:52,600
I mean, how do you live like that, honestly?

1084
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,660
How do you go to sleep when you know that
there's...

1085
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,270
For all we know,

1086
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:57,580
I could be walking into a trap right now.

1087
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,920
We could be dead the second I walk through that
door.

1088
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:03,610
Come on, kid. We got big things in store.

1089
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,980
Big things.

1090
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,620
Man of the hour. Take a curtsy.

1091
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,920
Goddamn ducks.

1092
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:26,850
Hey, hey, man!

1093
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:29,040
What's... Oh. Shit, sorry, sorry, dude.

1094
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,300
Um, okay.

1095
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:33,090
Anyway, just, awesome work, man.

1096
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:34,010
Really awesome.

1097
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:35,380
Right on, man. Right on.

1098
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:36,710
- Real cool. - Great.

1099
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:39,400
So now that we're all done going down on each
other,

1100
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:41,660
can we please hear the plan?

1101
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,340
Where are we at with Steel Mountain?

1102
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,660
If I'm not mistaken,

1103
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,350
these lines aren't 100% safe yet,

1104
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:48,310
and we still haven't made the Colby project
disappear.

1105
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,230
Seriously?

1106
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:51,420
It's been weeks. Any links or traces

1107
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:52,720
would have been owned by now.

1108
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,210
The lines are clean, Boss, I swear.

1109
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:57,640
- Thank you. - I mean, um...

1110
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,790
if it makes you feel better, Romero and I can
check...

1111
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,010
Great! Make me feel great.

1112
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:04,840
I'm gonna hang back over here, collect my
thoughts.

1113
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:16,090
What's her deal?

1114
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,080
Ah, she's a complicated woman.

1115
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,980
Most malware coders are. Am I right?

1116
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,030
She showed up at my apartment.

1117
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:24,230
Why does she know where I live?

1118
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:25,250
Let's not focus on her.

1119
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,930
That'll be like entering a bad K-hole you'll never
wake up from.

1120
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:30,590
Instead, I need you to focus on the next phase of
our project.

1121
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:33,120
Comet, the natural gas plant up around Albany?

1122
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:37,900
We're gonna blow it up.

1123
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,580
Why would you blow...

1124
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:44,160
Comet plant's right next to Steel Mountain.

1125
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,780
Which, as you know,

1126
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,590
is the off-site and data storage facility

1127
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,400
for every corporation in the S

1128
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,460
including everyone's favorite--

1129
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,350
- Evil Corp. - Bingo!

1130
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,520
You're gonna destroy their tape backups.

1131
00:21:57,610 --> 00:21:59,130
They're gonna be looking out for something like
that.

1132
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:01,760
They've been on high alert ever since the hack.

1133
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,210
From what I heard, they've caught their hacker.

1134
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:05,530
- Haven't they? - No, they haven't.

1135
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:08,210
- Tyrell Wellick knows. - What they want him to
know!

1136
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:10,350
He's a corporate robot just like the rest of them.

1137
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:12,530
Besides, the entire company is gonna be reeling

1138
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:14,400
from all the data dumps we've got in store for
them--

1139
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,180
and man, do we have some goodies.

1140
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,890
Some good old-fashioned executive racism,

1141
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:19,770
sexism, Fascism.

1142
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:22,200
Trust me, we are gonna "ism" so much all over them

1143
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,690
they won't be able to see straight.

1144
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:25,910
And asking for Colby's release as ransom was
genius.

1145
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:27,550
That'll only make his spotlight bigger,

1146
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:29,000
keeping it off us.

1147
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,340
That neat little ditty was Trenton's idea.

1148
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:34,200
She may look innocent, but I'd be careful.

1149
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:36,450
She's got some Allah Akbar in her.

1150
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,740
And while all that's going on,

1151
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:41,200
you will use your Allsafe security clearance

1152
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,650
to hack the Comet PLC, increase the pressure,

1153
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:45,430
causing a gas pipeline explosion

1154
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:49,180
making Steel Mountain go kablooey along with Evil
Corp's soul.

1155
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,960
They know about all this?

1156
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,020
You're the first.

1157
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,650
Workers?

1158
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:05,160
Anyone living around the plant...

1159
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:06,730
They all die?

1160
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:08,360
We'll give them a head start.

1161
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,120
Sound some alarms. They'll be fine.

1162
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,430
You're blowing up a gas pipeline.

1163
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:17,750
The world is a dangerous place, Elliot,

1164
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:19,260
not because of those who do evil,

1165
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:21,890
but because of those who look on and do nothing.

1166
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:22,950
This is war.

1167
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,940
People will die. C'est la mort.

1168
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,410
And once we blow up the pipeline,

1169
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:30,860
Darlene's worm will kick into high gear

1170
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:31,900
at the U.S. Data center

1171
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,530
which you helped to us install, thank you very
much.

1172
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:38,720
The redundant backups at their eastern data center
in China--

1173
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:41,640
the Dark Army is covering us on that.

1174
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:44,590
Dark Army? Why, man?

1175
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:46,570
They got no code. They hack for anyone:

1176
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:48,370
terrorists, North Korea, Iran, Russia--

1177
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:51,600
Which means they hate U.S. capitalism just as much
as anyone.

1178
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,660
Last but not least.

1179
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,130
Steel Mountain.

1180
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:00,280
The hacker's dilemma.

1181
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:03,370
What to do when a bunch of data you want to
destroy

1182
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:05,170
is completely off the grid?

1183
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,820
I'm not killing anyone.

1184
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:17,320
Tell me one thing, Elliot.

1185
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:20,080
Are you a one or a zero?

1186
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:23,310
That's the question you have to ask yourself.

1187
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:25,140
Are you a yes or a no?

1188
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:27,580
Are you going to act or not?

1189
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:34,250
Yo...you've been staring at a computer screen

1190
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,180
way too long, homie.

1191
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:38,140
Life's not that binary.

1192
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,370
Isn't it?

1193
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:41,980
Sure, there are grays--

1194
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:44,410
but when you come right down to it, at its core,

1195
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:48,190
beneath every choice, there's either a one or a
zero.

1196
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,950
You either do something or you don't.

1197
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:54,100
You walk out that door, you've decided to do
nothing,

1198
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:57,450
to say no, which means you do not come back.

1199
00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:00,980
You leave, you are no longer a part of this.

1200
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,550
You become a zero.

1201
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,740
If you stay,

1202
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,440
if you want to change the world,

1203
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:10,810
you become a yes.

1204
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:13,050
You become a one.

1205
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:15,580
So, I'll ask you again:

1206
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:19,180
are you a one or a zero?

1207
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:21,410
An innocent man is in prison because of what I
did.

1208
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:23,250
Come on, let's not kid ourselves!

1209
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,170
This has nothing to do with Colby.

1210
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,730
This isn't even about my revolution.

1211
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,310
This is more than that for you.

1212
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:37,310
This is about how those bastards slowly killed
your father

1213
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:39,020
and how you wished he'd done something about it.

1214
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:41,910
But he didn't. Because he was a zero,

1215
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:44,030
just like you're being right now.

1216
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:47,560
F--- you.

1217
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:53,080
Disappearing again?

1218
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:59,760
I'm not killing anyone. Leave me out of this.

1219
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:03,750
You don't get to disappear from this.

1220
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,260
We can do it with or without you,

1221
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:07,150
but you're a part of it either way!

1222
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:10,870
Yeah, even your stupid hoodie can't protect you,
bitch!

1223
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:12,090
This was a mistake.

1224
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:14,050
I've gotta turn them in. Should I turn them in?

1225
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:16,380
Will I get into trouble? Shit, she's right.

1226
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:19,010
I'm culpable now. No, we're culpable.

1227
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:22,550
You're in this with me, so start thinking of
solutions now.

1228
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:28,460
Shayla?

1229
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:35,730
Yo, Shayla.

1230
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:37,190
Yo, bro.

1231
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:39,890
Can I help you with something?

1232
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:46,500
I, uh...just need to talk to Shayla.

1233
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,050
Oh, your girl.

1234
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:49,940
She in the tub.

1235
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:56,450
Shayla.

1236
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:58,460
Yo, she'll be out in a minute.

1237
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,320
Can sit and wait if you want.

1238
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:06,930
I think we should check on her, make sure she's
all right.

1239
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:11,950
You a funny dude. I like you.

1240
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,460
Don't be rude.

1241
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:17,250
Sit down and chill.

1242
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,360
No, that's right.

1243
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,890
You only do this.

1244
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:46,780
Only nigga I know that take withdrawal meds while
he using.

1245
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:48,660
That's smart.

1246
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,270
Probably even convinced yourself you ain't an
addict.

1247
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,020
Oh, shit.

1248
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:57,690
Forgot to introduce myself. I'm Fernan--

1249
00:27:57,690 --> 00:27:59,430
Fernando Vera, Shayla's supplier.

1250
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:01,350
One of the worst human beings I've ever hacked.

1251
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:05,250
His password? "Eatadick6969."

1252
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:08,840
Aside from the massive amounts of money he spends
on porn and webcams,

1253
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:12,650
he does all his drug transactions through emails,
IMs, Twitter.

1254
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:15,520
The fact that the cops haven't caught him yet is
beyond me.

1255
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,780
If they had half a brain cell,

1256
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:19,510
they'd be able to crack his gang's simplistic
code,

1257
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:21,250
if it can even be called that.

1258
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:23,940
After only a couple of hours of timing his tweets

1259
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,380
with related news articles,

1260
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,240
I figured out that "biscuit" and "clickety"

1261
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,150
clearly referenced guns.

1262
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:31,940
"Food," "sea shells" or "gas" for bullets.

1263
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:34,890
And the ultimate: "Rock to sleep early."

1264
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:37,240
I haven't made the direct connection to a hit yet,

1265
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,970
but the math of guns plus bullets

1266
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:40,930
usually adds up to one thing.

1267
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:42,770
I've thought about turning him in,

1268
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:44,740
but he's Shayla's only supplier.

1269
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,040
I take him down, I lose my drugs,

1270
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:50,300
and with everything going on right now, I can't
have that.

1271
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,850
You get that, though?

1272
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:54,950
Anyway, bro,

1273
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:57,120
I ain't nothing to worry about.

1274
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:00,100
Just making a drop for you.

1275
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:03,310
What's your name, anyway?

1276
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,720
Elliot.

1277
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,460
What it mean?

1278
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,190
What, you ain't never Googled it?

1279
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:13,030
Man, you gotta do that.

1280
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:15,540
The meaning of a person's name is important, bro.

1281
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,260
Yo, she good! She good.

1282
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:24,000
Trust me.

1283
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:26,530
Took care of that shit myself.

1284
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:34,300
You remind me of me when I was younger,

1285
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:36,110
depressed and sullen.

1286
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:39,230
Matter of fact, tried to kill myself, a couple of
times.

1287
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,410
Never could get that shit right.

1288
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,160
Biology wasn't my strong suit.

1289
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:49,150
I hated myself, man. Still do.

1290
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:52,230
Thought that shit was a weakness for a long time.

1291
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:01,050
Then I realized that shit was my power.

1292
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:05,410
People walk around, act like they know what hate
means.

1293
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:09,970
Nah, no one does, until you hate yourself.

1294
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:11,120
I mean...

1295
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:14,080
truly hate yourself.

1296
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:17,230
That's power.

1297
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:31,090
You ain't scared of me, are you?

1298
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:36,170
That's good.

1299
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,590
Means I didn't waste my time making friends with
you.

1300
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,840
You don't really need these, do you?

1301
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,090
Man of your courage can last through a little
withdrawal.

1302
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:52,660
Ya know, you the only reason why I met Shayla.

1303
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,420
I'm the only nigga in town carrying everything,

1304
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,990
including your precious Suboxone.

1305
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:02,770
So, in a weird way, I should be thanking you.

1306
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,360
You brought her to me.

1307
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:07,480
Your star orbiting with mine, gravitationally,

1308
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:10,810
brought me the love of my life, Elliot.

1309
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:13,070
I mean, this, us?

1310
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,240
Being here?

1311
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,900
This has...

1312
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,640
beautiful meaning.

1313
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:22,120
But make no mistake, that girl in there...

1314
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:24,540
is mine.

1315
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:27,510
I don't know what I'd do without her.

1316
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,860
Now, I don't know what kind of arrangement

1317
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:34,750
you had with her before, but now that we
friends...

1318
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:38,500
I trust you respect this boundary.

1319
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:40,610
Feel me?

1320
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:53,860
A dude earlier today gave me that same look.

1321
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:56,070
Only thing I gotta say is,

1322
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,540
there's a smart time to be scared, bro...

1323
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:02,260
and a stupid time.

1324
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:10,090
Shayla?

1325
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:10,820
The lock pick.

1326
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,620
Every hacker's favorite sport.

1327
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,020
The perfect system to crack,

1328
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:16,090
mostly because unlike virtual systems,

1329
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:17,940
when you break it, you can feel it.

1330
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,840
You can see it. You can hear it.

1331
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,290
Shayla.

1332
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:34,050
Wake up.

1333
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,880
What happened?

1334
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:42,260
You okay?

1335
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:45,970
Why was that asshole here?

1336
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,000
Why am I in the tub?

1337
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:56,120
I don't know, um...I told him I needed your pills.

1338
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,160
He came over. We smoked a little.

1339
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,250
You remember having sex with him?

1340
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:05,080
What? No.

1341
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:07,300
But he definitely does.

1342
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,340
Okay, let's go.

1343
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,540
- Get your purse, make sure-- - Stop.

1344
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:12,790
I'm not going anywhere, okay?

1345
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:15,420
What do you mean?

1346
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,330
Oh, he's just gonna get away with it?

1347
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,840
You can't go back to him. Hey, I don't need the
pills.

1348
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,720
- Just find someone else. - I can't.

1349
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:31,150
He gives me a really good deal on the split.

1350
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,360
I make good money.

1351
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:35,550
There it is again,

1352
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:38,060
the invisible hand at work, controlling us,

1353
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:40,850
even if it pushes us past our threshold of pain.

1354
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:42,490
It's not gonna stop.

1355
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,650
What if he does it again?

1356
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:48,090
Promise me you won't do anything?

1357
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,480
I'm serious, Elliot.

1358
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,580
There's nothing to be done here.

1359
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:56,870
It's not like I have a choice.

1360
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,500
Would you mind sleeping here tonight?

1361
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:08,990
Choices.

1362
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:11,650
Maybe Mr. Robot's right.

1363
00:34:11,970 --> 00:34:15,790
That's what this is all about, the yesses and nos
of life.

1364
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:19,110
But do we decide them or do they decide us?

1365
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,950
Fernando Vera. I get rid of him,

1366
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:24,230
I get rid of my drug dealer's supplier.

1367
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:25,810
I get rid of the morphine.

1368
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:28,400
And the pain I've been holding in comes rushing
out.

1369
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,200
Sure, I can try to find another dealer,

1370
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,230
but like Vera said, no one on the streets deals
Suboxone.

1371
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:36,820
I could go back to digitally counterfeiting
scripts,

1372
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:39,620
but pharmas spend a lot of dough protecting their
wares.

1373
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:41,990
Most places only take paper scripts.

1374
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,800
Continuously getting legit refills isn't
realistic,

1375
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,490
and neither is being a junkie.

1376
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,830
So I quit cold turkey or let Vera exist.

1377
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:53,750
I know what you're thinking. The answer's too
obvious.

1378
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,100
Vera may have been groping Shayla before,

1379
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:57,640
but he's graduated to rape.

1380
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:04,530
Just like Shayla, he's left me no choice.

1381
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:07,470
He can't be allowed to exist anymore.

1382
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,450
Perhaps we should start with how you're feeling.

1383
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,880
Not good.

1384
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,100
What's not good right now?

1385
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:35,560
Everything.

1386
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:39,880
Humor me with some specifics.

1387
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:48,380
How do we know if we're in control?

1388
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:54,060
That we're not just making the best

1389
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:56,300
of what comes at us, and that's it.

1390
00:35:57,030 --> 00:36:00,520
Trying to constantly pick between two options.

1391
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:03,340
Like your two paintings in the waiting room.

1392
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:08,520
Or...Coke and Pepsi.

1393
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,830
McDonald's or Burger King?

1394
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:15,680
Hyundai or Honda?

1395
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,640
It's all part of the same blur, right?

1396
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,970
Just out of focus enough.

1397
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,100
It's the illusion of choice.

1398
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:33,980
Half of us can't even pick our own--

1399
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:36,910
our cable, gas, electric.

1400
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:41,240
The water we drink, our health insurance.

1401
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,630
Even if we did, would it matter?

1402
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:48,400
You know, if our only option is Blue Cross or Blue
Shield,

1403
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:50,820
what the f--- is the difference?

1404
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:58,270
In fact, aren't they-- aren't they the same?

1405
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,080
No, man...

1406
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:06,220
our choices are prepaid for us,

1407
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:08,160
long time ago.

1408
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:12,860
I'm sorry you feel you have no control.

1409
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:17,990
Thought I was doing something good.

1410
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:24,160
I was a part of this... project.

1411
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:28,830
Thought I was going to be a part of something
special.

1412
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:34,680
And now?

1413
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:36,610
Now...

1414
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:40,430
It turned out to be a mistake,

1415
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:42,610
like everything else.

1416
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:46,100
What's the point, right?

1417
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:50,720
Might as well, just-- you do nothing.

1418
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:53,350
Might as well do nothing.

1419
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,190
You've brought up this issue before,

1420
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:00,560
this issue of not feeling like you're in control.

1421
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,610
Do you remember?

1422
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:06,960
When we spoke about your father.

1423
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:10,550
You talked about how he chose to do nothing

1424
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:12,500
when he was battling his cancer.

1425
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:16,540
You told him he could have fought the company that
caused it.

1426
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:18,510
He could have told people about it.

1427
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,070
He could have sought better care than what he was
getting.

1428
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,530
Instead, he did nothing.

1429
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:29,770
Maybe your father felt the same way as you do now.

1430
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:33,870
After all, like you said, what's the point?

1431
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,630
- It's different. - What's different

1432
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:39,110
is you've found options, Elliot.

1433
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:42,510
That's the power you have. That's the control you
own.

1434
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:45,380
You don't have to just take what life gives you.

1435
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,000
Come on.

1436
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:51,440
Tell me what is going on with you.

1437
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,070
I cannot help you if you keep me in the dark.

1438
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:55,100
Shut up!

1439
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:00,080
Shut up!

1440
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:04,790
You've got bags under your eyes.

1441
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:06,780
You're yelling. You're jittery.

1442
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:08,820
For the last month, I have seen you

1443
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:11,750
slip into old patterns, old behaviors.

1444
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:17,010
What is going on?

1445
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,880
He's still not answering.

1446
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:21,620
Well, we'll just have to ask him tomorrow.

1447
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:24,380
Every time I try to play it or rip it,

1448
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:27,900
it just freezes up my computer and spits it back
out again.

1449
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:30,290
He's not okay.

1450
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:33,130
He was acting so out of it at work today.

1451
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:46,230
Are you saying something, babe?

1452
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,470
Something's wrong.

1453
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:49,440
Should I go over there?

1454
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,450
And just...

1455
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:53,270
Check in on him?

1456
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:56,420
Uh...come on.

1457
00:40:57,110 --> 00:40:58,220
That's ridiculous.

1458
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,920
You know he's always been a weirdo, right?

1459
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,680
I'm really worried about him.

1460
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:10,110
My Arizona buddy Fred hit me up.

1461
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:12,600
He wants to grab a drink.

1462
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:14,780
Shouldn't take too long.

1463
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:17,790
Okay.

1464
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:33,120
"Deep passions, longing...

1465
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:35,540
the two of them had never felt such a love,

1466
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,800
such closeness, such a connection."

1467
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,040
Found a way to do it without--

1468
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:44,420
Sit down.

1469
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:56,510
I know how to take out the backups

1470
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:58,040
without blowing up the pipeline.

1471
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,980
You know, Elliot, I really feel like we resolved

1472
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:02,550
this thing between us. Didn't you walk away?

1473
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:03,730
I did.

1474
00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:05,430
Didn't I say that if you walked away,

1475
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:06,900
you were no longer a part of this?

1476
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,260
I have a real plan--

1477
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:12,320
If you want me to let you back in,

1478
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,270
there's an understanding we have to come to,

1479
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,240
a debt you have to pay,

1480
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,230
because, remember, you walked away.

1481
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:19,810
I thought you didn't believe in debts.

1482
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:22,270
Not true. I believe in debts.

1483
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,810
I believe in erasing them.

1484
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:29,550
What do you want?

1485
00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:35,310
I want you to tell me about your father.

1486
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:38,640
You're not gonna get into my head, man.

1487
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,740
Your David Koresh shit isn't gonna work on me.

1488
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:42,070
Tell me how he died.

1489
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,670
Why, man? Something tells me

1490
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:46,440
you already looked that shit up anyway.

1491
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:47,680
I wanna hear it from you.

1492
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:56,680
So I do this...

1493
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:59,090
we go back to the arcade,

1494
00:43:59,090 --> 00:44:00,930
discuss the plan with the rest of them?

1495
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:17,260
I don't know what you want me to say.

1496
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:20,600
We were close. Very close.

1497
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,900
He was my best friend.

1498
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:25,070
Worked at Evil Corp his whole life.

1499
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,930
He was one of the best computer engineers they
had.

1500
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:31,890
And out of the blue, he got fired.

1501
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:32,980
No one knew why.

1502
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:35,670
Then one day he told me.

1503
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:38,630
He had leukemia.

1504
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:41,750
Made me swear to never tell anyone,

1505
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:43,200
especially my mom.

1506
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:45,570
So I didn't.

1507
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:47,760
A few months go by...

1508
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,030
he got sicker and sicker.

1509
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:52,920
Finally, I got so worried...

1510
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:56,170
told my mom.

1511
00:44:57,370 --> 00:44:59,880
When he found out, he got pissed.

1512
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:01,680
Started yelling.

1513
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:06,040
I remember I tried to hug him, tell him I'm sorry,
and...

1514
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:09,350
kept shoving me away and shoved me so hard

1515
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:11,610
I fell backwards out the window.

1516
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,520
I fell, and I broke my arm.

1517
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,560
Never spoke to me after that.

1518
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:19,100
Couldn't even look at me.

1519
00:45:19,930 --> 00:45:21,240
Even the night he died.

1520
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:26,480
We good?

1521
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:44,490
I understand what it's like to lose a parent.

1522
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:46,130
It's heartbreaking.

1523
00:45:50,270 --> 00:45:51,600
Did you ever think he was right?

1524
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:55,260
About what?

1525
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,210
Hurting you that day?

1526
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,290
For what you did to him?

1527
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:02,050
You ever think you deserved it?

1528
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:04,210
I didn't do anything to him.

1529
00:46:04,210 --> 00:46:05,630
I was trying to help him.

1530
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:07,100
For betraying his trust.

1531
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:09,430
I was eight years ol--

1532
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:17,710
You didn't commit to the sacred pact you'd formed.

1533
00:46:18,305 --> 00:47:18,195
