(female news announcer) Terry Colby,
the chief technology officer of...

164
00:11:47,867 --> 00:11:50,240
(Elliot voice-over) Terry Colby's
arrest is on everyone's mind.

165
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:55,328
Screen. Might as well be
the same thing nowadays.

166
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:57,297
How do I go back to work after this?

167
00:11:57,332 --> 00:11:59,299
How can I focus on anything?

168
00:11:59,334 --> 00:12:01,801
And when's Mr. Robot
going to contact me again?

169
00:12:01,837 --> 00:12:03,970
What's he waiting for?

170
00:12:04,006 --> 00:12:07,257
Did I just destroy a
man's life for no reason?

171
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:09,759
(Gideon) I'm gonna talk to HR
about a salary bump for you.

172
00:12:09,811 --> 00:12:11,177
- Oh, please.
- No, no.

173
00:12:11,229 --> 00:12:13,096
Take the raise.

174
00:12:13,148 --> 00:12:17,350
It's not gonna be much, but
it's the best I can do right now.

175
00:12:17,352 --> 00:12:18,685
Elliot...

176
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:20,737
You saved the company.

177
00:12:23,992 --> 00:12:27,861
Now...

178
00:12:27,863 --> 00:12:31,281
Why didn't you tell me about the DAT file?

179
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,533
You could've come in here at
any time before the meeting

180
00:12:33,585 --> 00:12:35,869
to say you found something, but you didn't.

181
00:12:35,871 --> 00:12:39,873
I gotta be honest. I
found that kind of curious.

182
00:12:42,377 --> 00:12:45,879
Yeah, I didn't know what I had.

183
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,131
Could've easily been a junk file.

184
00:12:48,183 --> 00:12:49,466
C'mon...

185
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:50,967
You're never sure about anything

186
00:12:51,019 --> 00:12:54,020
unless there's something to be sure about.

187
00:12:54,056 --> 00:12:57,857
Maybe you don't know me that well.

188
00:12:59,861 --> 00:13:02,195
Regardless,

189
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:05,732
I still need you to stay
on it, now more than ever.

190
00:13:05,734 --> 00:13:07,233
I mean, who knows what

191
00:13:07,235 --> 00:13:08,701
these Fsociety hackers
are going to do next.

192
00:13:08,737 --> 00:13:10,320
(Elliot voice-over) What did he just say?

193
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:13,406
- What did you just say?
- The ones working with Colby.

194
00:13:13,408 --> 00:13:15,909
Who knows how deep these
data dumps are going to get,

195
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,077
and Evil Corp is...

196
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,662
What're you talking about?

197
00:13:19,714 --> 00:13:21,581
There's a twist.

198
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,583
You're usually the one a step ahead of me.

199
00:13:23,635 --> 00:13:25,919
They hit the mother lode during the breach.

200
00:13:25,921 --> 00:13:29,255
Potentially terabytes
worth of emails and files.

201
00:13:29,257 --> 00:13:31,124
They're threatening to dump everything

202
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:33,343
unless the FBI frees Colby.

203
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:36,396
They released the video this morning.

204
00:13:43,271 --> 00:13:46,573
Hello, Evil Corp. We are Fsociety.

205
00:13:46,608 --> 00:13:48,575
Over the years, we have been watching you.

206
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:50,777
Your financial abuse of the poor;

207
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:52,612
your corruption of governments;

208
00:13:52,664 --> 00:13:55,782
your cover-ups of the murder
of innocent, ordinary citizens,

209
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:57,784
all for the sake of a profit.

210
00:13:57,786 --> 00:14:01,955
This is why we at Fsociety
have decided you must die.

211
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:05,625
We are malicious and
hostile. We do not compromise.

212
00:14:05,627 --> 00:14:07,127
We are relentless.

213
00:14:07,129 --> 00:14:09,379
We will not stop until every tentacle

214
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:13,299
of your evil monstrosity
is sliced off at the nerve.

215
00:14:13,351 --> 00:14:15,635
But we are also not without mercy.

216
00:14:15,687 --> 00:14:18,304
Our latest hack was our last warning.

217
00:14:18,306 --> 00:14:21,975
Meet our demands, and we will
consider not destroying you.

218
00:14:21,977 --> 00:14:24,561
First, release our leader Terry Colby

219
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:27,113
from your illegitimate prison immediately.

220
00:14:27,149 --> 00:14:30,150
Second, release all the people of the world

221
00:14:30,185 --> 00:14:33,570
from your even more
illegitimate prisons of debt.

222
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:36,156
Third, dissolve your corporation

223
00:14:36,158 --> 00:14:39,826
and donate all your assets
to charities around the world.

224
00:14:39,878 --> 00:14:42,195
This proposal is non-negotiable.

225
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:45,165
The people are realizing they
don't have freedom of choice

226
00:14:45,167 --> 00:14:46,332
so long as you exist.

227
00:14:46,384 --> 00:14:48,301
The people are waking up,

228
00:14:48,336 --> 00:14:51,171
no longer accepting your economic slavery.

229
00:14:51,173 --> 00:14:55,008
Meet these demands, or we will kill you.

230
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,843
Consider yourself warned.

231

Yo, yo, yo, yo, my album just dropped.

00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:09,734
Yo, please buy my CD.
Only cost you 20 likes.

235
00:15:09,786 --> 00:15:12,070
Yo, it'll give you the
feels, y'all, I swear.

236
00:15:12,122 --> 00:15:13,371
The CD's free. All's I ask is you Tweet.

237
00:15:13,406 --> 00:15:15,240
Help my social media outreach.

238
00:15:15,242 --> 00:15:17,208
(Ollie) You know, be like, "I
want to set up this meeting.

239
00:15:17,244 --> 00:15:20,412
It's like a very, like a... " Oh, Elliot!

240
00:15:20,732 --> 00:15:22,141
(Ollie) Hey, congrats, man.

241
00:15:22,142 --> 00:15:24,798
Allsafe is all over the
internet today because of you.

242
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:27,284
Dude, we should celebrate.
We have this Groupon

243
00:15:27,336 --> 00:15:29,286
for four at Morton's on Thursday.

244

This other couple we were
going with totally bailed.

245
00:15:31,457 --> 00:15:32,790
Why don't you come with?

246
00:15:32,792 --> 00:15:34,792
Their steaks are badass. It's $29.95...

247
00:15:34,827 --> 00:15:35,926
(Angela) I'm not sure that
Elliot would like that.

248
00:15:35,962 --> 00:15:37,011
Yeah, okay.

249
00:15:37,046 --> 00:15:39,630
Yeah? Okay. Awesome, man.

250
00:15:39,632 --> 00:15:42,633
And, hey, why don't we
make it a double date?

251
00:15:42,635 --> 00:15:44,018
I heard that you had a girlfriend.

252
00:15:44,053 --> 00:15:46,186
Ollie, you weren't
supposed to say anything.

253
00:15:46,222 --> 00:15:47,638
(Ollie) Babe, it's cool.
Elliot's okay with it.

254
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:49,974
Yeah, okay, sure. I... have to go.

255
00:15:49,976 --> 00:15:53,560
Um, my neighbor's complaining
about the dog barking again.

256
00:15:59,318 --> 00:16:02,404
- (Angela) Since when does he have a dog?
- (Cisco) Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

257
00:16:02,405 --> 00:16:03,454
You look like a beautiful couple.

258
00:16:03,489 --> 00:16:04,705
Yo, my album just dropped,

259
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,206
You like rap, hip-hop?

260
00:16:06,242 --> 00:16:08,542
Yo, this shit is deep, lyrical, poetic.

261
00:16:08,577 --> 00:16:10,210
Yo, your girl will like
this, my man, I swear.

262
00:16:10,246 --> 00:16:11,462
Come on, bro, you've
been outside our building

263
00:16:11,497 --> 00:16:12,663
for two weeks now.

264
00:16:12,665 --> 00:16:13,998
All right, you know, I'll take it,

265
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,332
if you leave us alone.

266
00:16:15,384 --> 00:16:17,334
Thank you, thank you, man, thank you.

267
00:16:17,336 --> 00:16:19,503
And I'll tweet, but only
if I like it, all right?

268
00:16:19,555 --> 00:16:21,388
I only have 48 followers, but it's growing.

269
00:16:21,424 --> 00:16:22,973
- No doubt, no doubt.
- Some tastemakers in there so...

270
00:16:23,009 --> 00:16:24,058
I feel you, I feel you.

271
00:16:24,093 --> 00:16:25,309
- Yeah.
- All right.

272
00:16:25,344 --> 00:16:26,677
Yo, I appreciate it, man, really.

273
00:16:26,729 --> 00:16:28,062
- You guys have a good day.
- Yeah, you too.

274
00:16:28,097 --> 00:16:29,396
Thank you so much. Check track two out.

275
00:16:29,432 --> 00:16:32,349
- Track two.
- All right, man.

276
00:16:32,351 --> 00:16:33,734
(Elliot voice-over) This
was never part of the plan.

277
00:16:33,769 --> 00:16:36,020
Data dumps? Releasing Terry Colby?

278
00:16:36,072 --> 00:16:37,855
None of this makes sense.

279
00:16:37,907 --> 00:16:40,407
Need to cut off all ties with Fsociety.

280
00:16:40,443 --> 00:16:41,859
Need to disconnect.

281

We need to call in sick

Well, I was waiting for you.

You were supposed to come last night.

289
00:17:09,772 --> 00:17:12,222
- Did you forget?
- Come? Where?

290
00:17:12,274 --> 00:17:14,274
It's fine, everyone's coming later.

take Flipper for a while.

Of course she needs a walk, Elliot.

She's a friggin' dog.

00:18:46,318 --> 00:18:47,534
He'll understand, right?

322
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:48,869
He'll know what to do.

323
00:18:48,904 --> 00:18:51,121
It's whatevs. He'll take me back.

324
00:18:51,157 --> 00:18:52,539
He's just gotta get over this whole

325
00:18:52,575 --> 00:18:55,542
"love is forever" bullshit.

326
00:18:55,578 --> 00:18:57,494
I'll do my disappearing act for a minute,

327
00:18:57,546 --> 00:18:59,463
and then he'll come to his senses.

328
00:18:59,498 --> 00:19:00,664
(male announcer) Stand
clear of the closing door.

329
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:03,217
You know, it's our thing.

330
00:19:03,252 --> 00:19:05,669
Quick!

331
00:19:05,671 --> 00:19:09,423
[indistinct female announcer over intercom]

332
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,896
(Elliot voice-over) Can she see them, too?

333
00:19:15,931 --> 00:19:17,381
What?

334
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:21,185
I like to stay on my toes.

335
00:19:21,237 --> 00:19:25,155
Speaking of, that's, like, one
of the most annoying things...

336
00:19:25,191 --> 00:19:28,859
(Elliot voice-over) But what if
Tyrell finds out? What will he do?

337
00:19:28,911 --> 00:19:31,245
Shit, there's basically
no scenario in which

338
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,031
I'm not getting killed or going to jail.

339
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:37,701
Because I wanted a turtle,
and he was like, "No..."

340
00:19:37,753 --> 00:19:40,087
(Darlene) I might need to crash
with you for a couple of nights.

341
00:19:40,122 --> 00:19:42,372
That's cool, right?

342
00:19:42,424 --> 00:19:44,041
Seriously?

343
00:19:44,043 --> 00:19:46,376
Fine! I'll crash at Mobley's.

344
00:19:46,378 --> 00:19:48,512
Don't love dogs anyway.

345
00:19:48,547 --> 00:19:50,264
Especially ones that shit in your bed.

346
00:19:50,299 --> 00:19:52,382
I mean, how do you live
like that, honestly?

347
00:19:52,434 --> 00:19:54,218
How do you go to sleep when
you know that there's...

348
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:55,686
(Elliot voice-over) For all we know,

349
00:19:55,721 --> 00:19:57,387
I could be walking into a trap right now.

350
00:19:57,389 --> 00:19:59,556
We could be dead the second
I walk through that door.

351
00:19:59,608 --> 00:20:03,443
Come on, kid. We got big things in store.

352
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:05,312
Big things.

353
00:20:10,726 --> 00:20:13,728
[clapping]

354
00:20:13,764 --> 00:20:16,231
Man of the hour. Take a curtsy.

355
00:20:19,869 --> 00:20:21,035
[gunshot]

356
00:20:21,037 --> 00:20:22,753
Goddamn ducks.

357
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:25,456
[three gunshots]

358
00:20:25,508 --> 00:20:26,958
Hey, hey, man!

359
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:28,960
What's... oh. Shit, sorry, sorry, dude.

360
00:20:29,012 --> 00:20:30,711
Um, okay.

361
00:20:30,713 --> 00:20:32,847
Anyway, just, awesome work, man.

362
00:20:32,882 --> 00:20:33,965
Really awesome.

363
00:20:34,017 --> 00:20:35,099
Right on, man. Right on.

364
00:20:35,134 --> 00:20:36,884
- Real cool.
- Great.

365
00:20:36,886 --> 00:20:39,020
So now that we're all done
going down on each other,

366
00:20:39,055 --> 00:20:41,689
can we please hear the plan?

367
00:20:41,724 --> 00:20:43,107
Where are we at with Steel Mountain?

368
00:20:43,142 --> 00:20:44,492
(Mr. Robot) If I'm not mistaken,

369
00:20:44,527 --> 00:20:46,327
these lines aren't 100% safe yet,

370
00:20:46,362 --> 00:20:48,029
and we still haven't made
the Colby project disappear.

371
00:20:48,064 --> 00:20:49,123
Seriously?

372
00:20:49,132 --> 00:20:51,182
It's been weeks. Any links or traces

373
00:20:51,234 --> 00:20:52,517
would have been owned by now.

374
00:20:52,569 --> 00:20:54,819
The lines are clean, Boss, I swear.

375
00:20:54,854 --> 00:20:57,205
- Thank you.
- I mean, um...

376
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,340
if it makes you feel better,
Romero and I can check...

377
00:20:59,376 --> 00:21:01,693
Great! Make me feel great.

378
00:21:01,745 --> 00:21:04,912
I'm gonna hang back over
here, collect my thoughts.

379
00:21:07,534 --> 00:21:08,750
[groans] Ohh!

380
00:21:14,257 --> 00:21:15,707
What's her deal?

381
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:17,625
Ah, she's a complicated woman.

382
00:21:17,627 --> 00:21:19,727
Most malware coders are. Am I right?

383
00:21:19,763 --> 00:21:22,230
She showed up at my apartment.

384
00:21:22,265 --> 00:21:23,798
Why does she know where I live?

385
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:25,466
Let's not focus on her. That'll be like

386
00:21:25,502 --> 00:21:27,351
entering a bad K-hole
you'll never wake up from.

387
00:21:27,387 --> 00:21:30,438
Instead, I need you to focus on
the next phase of our project.

388
00:21:30,473 --> 00:21:34,142
Comet, the natural gas
plant up around Albany?

389
00:21:36,146 --> 00:21:39,063
We're gonna blow it up.

390
00:21:39,115 --> 00:21:41,949
Why would you blow...

391
00:21:41,985 --> 00:21:43,901
Comet plant's right next to Steel Mountain.

392
00:21:43,953 --> 00:21:45,987
Which, as you know,

393
00:21:45,989 --> 00:21:48,456
is the off-site and data storage facility

394
00:21:48,491 --> 00:21:49,907
for every corporation in the S&P,

395
00:21:49,959 --> 00:21:51,209
including everyone's favorite...

396
00:21:51,244 --> 00:21:54,045
- Evil Corp.
- [snaps fingers] Bingo!

397
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,547
You're gonna destroy their tape backups.

398
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:58,800
They're gonna be looking
out for something like that.

399
00:21:58,835 --> 00:22:01,219
They've been on high
alert ever since the hack.

400
00:22:01,254 --> 00:22:03,137
From what I heard, they've
caught their hacker.

401
00:22:03,173 --> 00:22:05,473
- Haven't they?
- No, they haven't.

402
00:22:05,508 --> 00:22:08,009
- Tyrell Wellick knows.
- What they want him to know!

403
00:22:08,011 --> 00:22:10,061
He's a corporate robot
just like the rest of them.

404
00:22:10,096 --> 00:22:12,430
Besides, the entire
company is gonna be reeling

405
00:22:12,482 --> 00:22:14,348
from all the data dumps
we've got in store for them...

406
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:15,817
and man, do we have some goodies.

407
00:22:15,852 --> 00:22:17,819
Some good old-fashioned executive racism,

408
00:22:17,854 --> 00:22:19,854
sexism, fascism.

409
00:22:19,856 --> 00:22:21,773
Trust me, we are gonna
"ism" so much all over them

410
00:22:21,825 --> 00:22:23,574
they won't be able to see straight.

411
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:25,777
And asking for Colby's
release as ransom was genius.

412
00:22:25,829 --> 00:22:27,328
That'll only make his spotlight bigger,

413
00:22:27,363 --> 00:22:28,946
keeping it off us.

414
00:22:28,998 --> 00:22:31,833
That neat little ditty was Trenton's idea.

415
00:22:31,868 --> 00:22:34,085
She may look innocent, but I'd be careful.

416
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,921
She's got some Allah Akbar in her.

417
00:22:36,956 --> 00:22:38,539
And while all that's going on,

418
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:41,042
you will use your
Allsafe security clearance

419
00:22:41,044 --> 00:22:43,544
to hack the Comet PLC,
increase the pressure,

420
00:22:43,546 --> 00:22:45,379
causing a gas pipeline explosion

421
00:22:45,381 --> 00:22:47,181
making Steel Mountain go kablooey

422
00:22:47,217 --> 00:22:49,217
along with Evil Corp's soul.

423
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:56,641
They know about all this?

424
00:22:56,693 --> 00:22:58,559
You're the first.

425
00:23:01,231 --> 00:23:03,231
Workers?

426
00:23:03,233 --> 00:23:04,649
Anyone living around the plant...

427
00:23:04,701 --> 00:23:06,450
They all die?

428
00:23:06,486 --> 00:23:08,236
We'll give them a head start.

429
00:23:08,238 --> 00:23:11,239
Sound some alarms. They'll be fine.

430
00:23:13,576 --> 00:23:15,409
You're blowing up a gas pipeline.

431
00:23:15,411 --> 00:23:17,545
The world is a dangerous place, Elliot,

432
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,130
not because of those who do evil,

433
00:23:19,165 --> 00:23:21,332
but because of those who
look on and do nothing.

434
00:23:21,384 --> 00:23:22,583
This is war.

435
00:23:22,585 --> 00:23:24,752
People will die. <i>C'est la mort.</i>

436
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:27,839
And once we blow up the pipeline,

437
00:23:27,891 --> 00:23:30,141
Darlene's worm will kick into high gear

438
00:23:30,176 --> 00:23:31,843
at the U.S. data center

439
00:23:31,895 --> 00:23:35,730
which you helped to us
install, thank you very much.

440
00:23:35,765 --> 00:23:39,183
The redundant backups at their
eastern data center in China...

441
00:23:39,235 --> 00:23:41,652
the Dark Army is covering us on that.

442
00:23:41,688 --> 00:23:44,655
Dark Army? Why, man?

443
00:23:44,691 --> 00:23:46,357
They got no code. They hack for anyone:

444
00:23:46,409 --> 00:23:48,276
terrorists, North Korea, Iran, Russia...

445
00:23:48,278 --> 00:23:49,744
Which means they hate U.S. capitalism

446
00:23:49,779 --> 00:23:53,497
just as much as anyone.

447
00:23:53,533 --> 00:23:56,450
Last but not least.

448
00:23:56,452 --> 00:23:58,035
Steel Mountain.

449
00:23:58,087 --> 00:24:01,122
The hacker's dilemma. What to do

450
00:24:01,124 --> 00:24:03,007
when a bunch of data you want to destroy

451
00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:05,209
is completely off the grid?

452
00:24:05,261 --> 00:24:06,544
[explosion noise]

453
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,401
I'm not killing anyone.

454
00:24:15,388 --> 00:24:17,605
Tell me one thing, Elliot.

455
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,640
Are you a one or a zero?

456
00:24:21,277 --> 00:24:22,944
That's the question you
have to ask yourself.

457
00:24:22,979 --> 00:24:25,112
Are you a yes or a no?

458
00:24:25,148 --> 00:24:27,982
Are you going to act or not?

459
00:24:30,987 --> 00:24:33,788
Yo... you've been staring
at a computer screen

460
00:24:33,823 --> 00:24:35,957
way too long, homie.

461
00:24:35,992 --> 00:24:37,708
Life's not that binary.

462
00:24:37,744 --> 00:24:39,660
Isn't it?

463
00:24:39,662 --> 00:24:41,963
Sure, there are grays...

464
00:24:41,998 --> 00:24:44,081
but when you come right
down to it, at its core,

465
00:24:44,133 --> 00:24:48,085
beneath every choice, there's
either a one or a zero.

466
00:24:48,137 --> 00:24:51,222
You either do something or you don't.

467
00:24:51,257 --> 00:24:53,841
You walk out that door,
you've decided to do nothing,

468
00:24:53,843 --> 00:24:57,678
to say no, which means
you do not come back.

469
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:01,015
You leave, you are no
longer a part of this.

470
00:25:01,017 --> 00:25:03,901
You become a zero.

471
00:25:03,937 --> 00:25:05,686
If you stay,

472
00:25:05,688 --> 00:25:08,773
if you want to change the world,

473
00:25:08,825 --> 00:25:10,574
you become a yes.

474
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:13,778
You become a one.

475
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:15,947
So, I'll ask you again:

476
00:25:15,999 --> 00:25:19,250
are you a one or a zero?

477
00:25:19,285 --> 00:25:21,452
An innocent man is in
prison because of what I did.

478
00:25:21,504 --> 00:25:22,954
Come on, let's not kid ourselves!

479
00:25:23,006 --> 00:25:26,540
This has nothing to do with Colby.

480
00:25:29,545 --> 00:25:31,512
This isn't even about my revolution.

481
00:25:31,547 --> 00:25:34,215
This is more than that for you.

482
00:25:34,217 --> 00:25:37,101
This is about how those bastards
slowly killed your father

483
00:25:37,136 --> 00:25:38,769
and how you wished he'd
done something about it.

484
00:25:38,805 --> 00:25:41,689
But he didn't. Because he was a zero,

485
00:25:41,724 --> 00:25:44,225
just like you're being right now.

486
00:25:46,229 --> 00:25:48,229
Fuck you.

487
00:25:51,434 --> 00:25:54,268
Disappearing again?

488
00:25:56,272 --> 00:25:59,406
I'm not killing anyone.
Leave me out of this.

489
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,861
You don't get to disappear from this.

490
00:26:03,913 --> 00:26:05,279
We can do it with or without you,

491
00:26:05,281 --> 00:26:07,531
but you're a part of it either way!

492
00:26:07,583 --> 00:26:10,718
Yeah, even your stupid hoodie
can't protect you, bitch!

493
00:26:10,753 --> 00:26:12,253
(Elliot voice-over) This was a mistake.

494
00:26:12,288 --> 00:26:13,954
I've gotta turn them in.
Should I turn them in?

495
00:26:13,956 --> 00:26:16,257
Will I get into trouble? Shit, she's right.

496
00:26:16,292 --> 00:26:18,959
I'm culpable now. No, we're culpable.

497
00:26:18,961 --> 00:26:22,096
You're in this with me, so
start thinking of solutions now.

498
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:26,872
[muffled electronic music]

499
00:26:26,908 --> 00:26:28,908
Shayla?

500
00:26:33,881 --> 00:26:35,631
[knocking on door] Yo, Shayla.

501
00:26:36,067 --> 00:26:38,317
Yo, bro.

502
00:26:38,369 --> 00:26:40,903
Can I help you with something?

503
00:26:43,374 --> 00:26:46,959
I, uh... just need to talk to Shayla.

504
00:26:46,994 --> 00:26:48,911
Oh, your girl.

505
00:26:48,963 --> 00:26:50,963
She in the tub.

506
00:26:55,169 --> 00:26:56,802
[knocking on door] Shayla.

507
00:26:56,837 --> 00:26:58,837
Yo, she'll be out in a minute.

508
00:27:00,742 --> 00:27:03,859
Can sit and wait if you want.

509
00:27:03,911 --> 00:27:06,779
I think we should check on
her, make sure she's all right.

510
00:27:06,831 --> 00:27:09,281
[laughs]

511
00:27:09,334 --> 00:27:13,202
You a funny dude. I like you.

512
00:27:13,254 --> 00:27:15,338
Don't be rude.

513
00:27:15,373 --> 00:27:18,207
Sit down and chill.

514
00:27:36,027 --> 00:27:38,561
No, that's right.

515
00:27:41,566 --> 00:27:43,616
You only do this.

516
00:27:43,651 --> 00:27:47,570
Only nigga I know that take
withdrawal meds while he using.

517
00:27:47,622 --> 00:27:49,822
That's smart.

518
00:27:49,874 --> 00:27:52,658
Probably even convinced
yourself you ain't an addict.

519
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:55,344
[laughs] Oh, shit.

520
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,646
Forgot to introduce myself. I'm Fernan...

521
00:27:57,682 --> 00:27:59,648
(Elliot voice-over) Fernando
Vera, Shayla's supplier.

522
00:27:59,684 --> 00:28:01,817
One of the worst human
beings I've ever hacked.

523
00:28:01,853 --> 00:28:05,521
His password? "eatadick6969."

524
00:28:05,556 --> 00:28:07,456
Aside from the massive amounts of money

525
00:28:07,492 --> 00:28:09,125
he spends on porn and webcams,

526
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,393
he does all his drug transactions

527
00:28:10,428 --> 00:28:12,695
through emails, IMs, Twitter.

528
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:15,231
The fact that the cops haven't
caught him yet is beyond me.

529
00:28:15,266 --> 00:28:16,999
If they had half a brain cell,

530
00:28:17,034 --> 00:28:19,502
they'd be able to crack
his gang's simplistic code,

531
00:28:19,537 --> 00:28:21,654
if it can even be called that.

532
00:28:21,689 --> 00:28:23,873
After only a couple of
hours of timing his tweets

533
00:28:23,908 --> 00:28:25,341
with related news articles,

534
00:28:25,376 --> 00:28:27,243
I figured out that "biscuit" and "clickety"

535
00:28:27,278 --> 00:28:29,078
clearly referenced guns.

536
00:28:29,113 --> 00:28:32,047
"Food," "sea shells" or "gas" for bullets.

537
00:28:32,083 --> 00:28:34,850
And the ultimate: "rock to sleep early."

538
00:28:34,886 --> 00:28:37,019
I haven't made the direct
connection to a hit yet,

539
00:28:37,054 --> 00:28:38,888
but the math of guns plus bullets

540
00:28:38,923 --> 00:28:41,023
usually adds up to one thing.

541
00:28:41,058 --> 00:28:42,558
I've thought about turning him in,

542
00:28:42,593 --> 00:28:44,727
but he's Shayla's only supplier.

543
00:28:44,762 --> 00:28:47,029
I take him down, I lose my drugs,

544
00:28:47,064 --> 00:28:50,366
and with everything going on
right now, I can't have that.

545
00:28:50,401 --> 00:28:53,035
You get that, though? [inhales]

546
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:55,204
[laughs] Anyway, bro,

547
00:28:55,239 --> 00:28:58,407
I ain't nothing to worry about.

548
00:28:58,443 --> 00:29:01,861
Just making a drop for you.

549
00:29:01,896 --> 00:29:03,446
What's your name, anyway?

550
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:07,149
Elliot.

551
00:29:07,201 --> 00:29:08,951
(Vera) What it mean?

552
00:29:08,986 --> 00:29:11,787
What, you ain't never Googled it?

553
00:29:11,823 --> 00:29:13,355
Man, you gotta do that.

554
00:29:13,391 --> 00:29:15,624
The meaning of a person's
name is important, bro.

555
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:18,928
Yo, she good! She good.

556
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,700
Trust me.

557
00:29:24,735 --> 00:29:27,736
Took care of that shit myself.

558
00:29:32,243 --> 00:29:34,477
You remind me of me when I was younger,

559
00:29:34,512 --> 00:29:36,579
depressed and sullen.

560
00:29:36,614 --> 00:29:40,549
Matter of fact, tried to kill
myself, a couple of times.

561
00:29:40,585 --> 00:29:42,751
Never could get that shit right.

562
00:29:42,787 --> 00:29:45,621
Biology wasn't my strong suit.

563
00:29:46,156 --> 00:29:49,125
I hated myself, man. Still do.

564
00:29:49,126 --> 00:29:52,828
Thought that shit was a
weakness for a long time.

565
00:29:58,669 --> 00:30:02,404
Then I realized that shit was my power.

566
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:05,307
People walk around, act like
they know what hate means.

567
00:30:05,343 --> 00:30:09,745
Nah, no one does, until you hate yourself.

568
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:12,281
I mean...

569
00:30:12,316 --> 00:30:15,184
truly hate yourself.

570
00:30:15,819 --> 00:30:17,786
That's power.

571
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:34,570
You ain't scared of me, are you?

572
00:30:34,906 --> 00:30:36,872
That's good.

573
00:30:36,908 --> 00:30:39,625
Means I didn't waste my
time making friends with you.

574
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:42,077
[chuckles]

575
00:30:42,078 --> 00:30:44,030
You don't really need these, do you?

576
00:30:44,082 --> 00:30:48,618
Man of your courage can last
through a little withdrawal.

577
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:53,089
Ya know, you the only
reason why I met Shayla.

578
00:30:53,124 --> 00:30:56,259
I'm the only nigga in
town carrying everything,

579
00:30:56,294 --> 00:30:58,711
including your precious Suboxone.

580
00:30:58,763 --> 00:31:02,632
So, in a weird way, I
should be thanking you.

581
00:31:02,684 --> 00:31:04,216
You brought her to me.

582
00:31:04,269 --> 00:31:07,219
Your star orbiting with
mine, gravitationally,

583
00:31:07,272 --> 00:31:10,640
brought me the love of my life, Elliot.

584
00:31:10,692 --> 00:31:12,558
I mean, this, us?

585
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:14,393
Being here?

586
00:31:14,445 --> 00:31:16,729
This has...

587
00:31:16,781 --> 00:31:19,198
beautiful meaning.

588
00:31:19,233 --> 00:31:22,902
But make no mistake, that girl in there...

589
00:31:22,954 --> 00:31:25,221
is mine.

590
00:31:25,256 --> 00:31:27,890
I don't know what I'd do without her.

591
00:31:27,925 --> 00:31:30,426
Now, I don't know what kind of arrangement

592
00:31:30,461 --> 00:31:36,098
you had with her before,
but now that we friends...

593
00:31:36,134 --> 00:31:38,901
I trust you respect this boundary.

594
00:31:38,936 --> 00:31:40,936
Feel me?

595
00:31:48,579 --> 00:31:50,846
[chuckles]

596
00:31:50,898 --> 00:31:53,733
A dude earlier today
gave me that same look.

597
00:31:53,768 --> 00:31:55,901
Only thing I gotta say is,

598
00:31:55,937 --> 00:31:58,654
there's a smart time to be scared, bro...

599
00:32:00,825 --> 00:32:02,825
And a stupid time.

600
00:32:03,928 --> 00:32:05,494
[door closes]

601
00:32:08,499 --> 00:32:09,832
Shayla?

602
00:32:09,867 --> 00:32:11,283
(Elliot voice-over) The lock pick.

603
00:32:11,336 --> 00:32:12,868
Every hacker's favorite sport.

604
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,286
The perfect system to crack,

605
00:32:14,339 --> 00:32:16,288
mostly because unlike virtual systems,

606
00:32:16,341 --> 00:32:18,207
when you break it, you can feel it.

607
00:32:18,259 --> 00:32:19,675
You can see it. You can hear it.

608
00:32:19,711 --> 00:32:21,010
[metal clatters]

609
00:32:26,134 --> 00:32:29,969
Shayla.

610
00:32:30,021 --> 00:32:31,437
Hey.

611
00:32:31,472 --> 00:32:32,972
Shayla.

612
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:35,725
Wake up.

613
00:32:35,777 --> 00:32:38,477
Mm.

614
00:32:38,529 --> 00:32:41,113
What happened?

615
00:32:41,149 --> 00:32:44,200
You okay?

616
00:32:44,235 --> 00:32:46,369
Why was that asshole here?

617
00:32:46,404 --> 00:32:48,237
Why am I in the tub?

618
00:32:52,619 --> 00:32:55,588
(Shayla) I don't know, um...
I told him I needed your pills.

619
00:32:55,623 --> 00:32:59,892
He came over. We smoked a little.

620
00:33:00,727 --> 00:33:02,427
You remember having sex with him?

621
00:33:02,462 --> 00:33:05,864
What? No.

622
00:33:05,899 --> 00:33:07,465
(Elliot voice-over)
But he definitely does.

623
00:33:07,501 --> 00:33:08,800
Okay, let's go.

624
00:33:08,835 --> 00:33:10,869
- Get your purse, make sure...
- Stop.

625
00:33:10,904 --> 00:33:14,472
I'm not going anywhere, okay?

626
00:33:14,508 --> 00:33:15,941
What do you mean?

627
00:33:15,976 --> 00:33:18,076
Oh, he's just gonna get away with it?

628
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,913
You can't go back to him.
Hey, I don't need the pills.

629
00:33:21,949 --> 00:33:24,950
- Just find someone else.
- I can't.

630
00:33:28,789 --> 00:33:32,657
He gives me a really
good deal on the split.

631
00:33:32,693 --> 00:33:34,492
I make good money.

632
00:33:34,528 --> 00:33:36,294
(Elliot voice-over) There it is again,

633
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:38,296
the invisible hand at work, controlling us,

634
00:33:38,332 --> 00:33:41,299
even if it pushes us past
our threshold of pain.

635
00:33:41,335 --> 00:33:44,502
It's not gonna stop.

636
00:33:44,538 --> 00:33:46,471
What if he does it again?

637
00:33:46,506 --> 00:33:50,075
Promise me you won't do anything?

638
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:52,077
I'm serious, Elliot.

639
00:33:52,112 --> 00:33:55,080
There's nothing to be done here.

640
00:33:55,115 --> 00:33:57,382
It's not like I have a choice.

641
00:33:59,219 --> 00:34:00,518
Hey...

642
00:34:00,554 --> 00:34:03,455
Would you mind sleeping here tonight?

643
00:34:08,061 --> 00:34:09,828
(Elliot voice-over) Choices.

644
00:34:09,863 --> 00:34:12,097
Maybe Mr. Robot's right.

645
00:34:12,132 --> 00:34:16,167
That's what this is all about,
the yesses and nos of life.

646
00:34:16,203 --> 00:34:19,871
But do we decide them or do they decide us?

647
00:34:19,906 --> 00:34:22,207
Fernando Vera. I get rid of him,

648
00:34:22,242 --> 00:34:24,376
I get rid of my drug dealer's supplier.

649
00:34:24,411 --> 00:34:26,177
I get rid of the morphine.

650
00:34:26,213 --> 00:34:29,647
And the pain I've been
holding in comes rushing out.

651
00:34:29,683 --> 00:34:31,483
Sure, I can try to find another dealer,

652
00:34:31,485 --> 00:34:34,519
but like Vera said, no one
on the streets deals Suboxone.

653
00:34:34,554 --> 00:34:36,955
I could go back to digitally
counterfeiting scripts,

654
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:39,991
but pharmas spend a lot of
dough protecting their wares.

655
00:34:39,993 --> 00:34:42,327
Most places only take paper scripts.

656
00:34:42,379 --> 00:34:44,796
Continuously getting legit
refills isn't realistic,

657
00:34:44,831 --> 00:34:46,831
and neither is being a junkie.

658
00:34:46,883 --> 00:34:50,885
So I quit cold turkey or let Vera exist.

659
00:34:50,921 --> 00:34:53,838
I know what you're thinking.
The answer's too obvious.

660
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:56,341
Vera may have been groping Shayla before,

661
00:34:56,393 --> 00:34:58,259
but he's graduated to rape.

662
00:35:01,932 --> 00:35:05,517
Just like Shayla, he's left me no choice.

663
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:08,520
He can't be allowed to exist anymore.

664
00:35:20,534 --> 00:35:24,536
(Krista) Perhaps we should
start with how you're feeling.

665
00:35:27,924 --> 00:35:30,708
Not good.

684

Even if we did, would it matter?

685

You know, if our only option
is Blue Cross or Blue Shield,

when he was battling his cancer.

708

You told him he could have

709

fought the company that caused it.

710
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:18,509
He could have told people about it.

711

He could have sought better
care than what he was getting.

Instead, he did nothing.

Made me swear to never tell anyone,

809
00:44:42,163 --> 00:44:45,114
especially my mom.

810
00:44:45,166 --> 00:44:46,449
So I didn't.

811
00:44:46,501 --> 00:44:48,617
A few months go by...

812
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:51,203
he got sicker and sicker.

813
00:44:51,205 --> 00:44:55,291
Finally, I got so worried...

814
00:44:55,343 --> 00:44:57,460
told my mom.

815
00:44:57,512 --> 00:45:00,270
When he found out, he got pissed.

816
00:45:00,348 --> 00:45:02,715
Started yelling.

817
00:45:02,767 --> 00:45:06,886
I remember I tried to hug
him, tell him I'm sorry, and...

818
00:45:06,938 --> 00:45:09,389
kept shoving me away and shoved me so hard

819
00:45:09,441 --> 00:45:11,391
I fell backwards out the window.

820
00:45:11,393 --> 00:45:14,894
I fell, and I broke my arm.

821
00:45:14,946 --> 00:45:17,397
Never spoke to me after that.

822
00:45:17,749 --> 00:45:19,615
Couldn't even look at me.

823
00:45:19,667 --> 00:45:22,285
Even the night he died.

824
00:45:25,673 --> 00:45:29,509
- We good?
- [sighs]

825
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:44,891
I understand what it's
like to lose a parent.

826
00:45:44,943 --> 00:45:47,143
It's heartbreaking.

827
00:45:50,148 --> 00:45:54,283
Did you ever think he was right?

828
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:56,118
About what?

829
00:45:56,154 --> 00:45:58,654
Hurting you that day?

830
00:45:58,706 --> 00:46:00,623
For what you did to him?

831
00:46:00,658 --> 00:46:02,408
You ever think you deserved it?

832
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:04,243
I didn't do anything to him.

833
00:46:04,245 --> 00:46:06,078
I was trying to help him.

834
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:07,683
For betraying his trust.

835
00:46:07,684 --> 00:46:09,882
I was eight years ol...

836
00:46:15,139 --> 00:46:18,023
You didn't commit to the
sacred pact you'd formed.
