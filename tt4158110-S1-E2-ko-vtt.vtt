00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.431
지금 내가 알려주는 건
일급 비밀이야

2
00:00:03.796 --> 00:00:04.966
이빌 주식회사

3
00:00:05.804 --> 00:00:07.283
안녕하세요
타렐 윌릭입니다

4
00:00:07.284 --> 00:00:08.613
나랑 이거 같이 할래?

5
00:00:08.614 --> 00:00:10.659
- 순수한 몰리야
- 됐어, 샤일라

6
00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.227
올세이프로 빨리 와

7
00:00:12.228 --> 00:00:13.461
젠장, 네트워크까지 당했어

8
00:00:13.462 --> 00:00:15.685
에프 소사이어티
해커의 정체다

9
00:00:15.686 --> 00:00:17.264
왠지 지우면 안될것 같아

10
00:00:19.041 --> 00:00:20.135
누구세요?

11
00:00:20.136 --> 00:00:21.469
나랑 같이 가자

12
00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:22.804
쟤는 달린이야

13
00:00:22.805 --> 00:00:24.889
DAT 파일을 수정해서

14
00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:26.473
콜비의 IP주소를 끼워넣어

15
00:00:26.525 --> 00:00:28.059
그렇게 하면

16
00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.692
세계에서 가장 큰 혁명의
시발점이 되는거야

17
00:00:33.916 --> 00:00:35.734
정보에 의하면
해커들은 콜비와

18
00:00:35.735 --> 00:00:37.902
유착관계에 있는 것으로
드러났습니다

19
00:00:37.903 --> 00:00:40.487
차에 타시죠

20
00:00:45.878 --> 00:00:47.544
안녕, 엘리엇

21
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.074
사이트에 기여하거나 VIP멤버를 가입하셨을 경우, www.OpenSubtitles.org의 광고가 사라집니다.

22
00:01:11.187 --> 00:01:13.555
총이 있으면, 그 사람은
은행을 털 수 있다

23
00:01:13.556 --> 00:01:17.592
하지만 은행이 있으면
그 자는 세상을 털 수 있다

24
00:01:17.593 --> 00:01:19.994
멍청한 소리죠

25
00:01:19.995 --> 00:01:22.396
환원주의적이고

26
00:01:22.397 --> 00:01:24.366
하지만 전
이 표현이 좋아요

27
00:01:24.367 --> 00:01:26.334
사람들 대부분은 싫어하죠

28
00:01:26.335 --> 00:01:29.112
권력은 그것을 쟁취한 자에게

29
00:01:29.113 --> 00:01:31.740
속한다는 걸 의미하니깐요

30
00:01:31.741 --> 00:01:34.409
아무리 열심히 일해도,
아무리 크게 꿈을 꿔도

31
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.712
능력이 아무리 적합해도
다 소용없어요

32
00:01:37.713 --> 00:01:42.759
실천 의지만이
가장 필요한 조건인거죠

33
00:01:43.166 --> 00:01:45.490
이렇게 모시게 되서
유감스러울 따름이에요

34
00:01:45.491 --> 00:01:47.307
사실 저희가 지금 하는게

35
00:01:47.308 --> 00:01:48.923
불법적이라
간주될 수 있거든요

36
00:01:48.924 --> 00:01:50.725
그 때문에 제가 지금

37
00:01:50.726 --> 00:01:53.787
변호사 11명에게
둘러쌓여있는 거겠죠

38
00:01:56.339 --> 00:01:58.830
엘리엇 올더슨

39
00:01:59.879 --> 00:02:02.010
당신에게...

40
00:02:02.104 --> 00:02:06.511
이빌 사의 자리를
제안하고 싶군요

41
00:02:07.076 --> 00:02:10.744
저희 사이버보안 부서의
책임자가 되어주세요

42
00:02:10.745 --> 00:02:13.748
저희가 올세이프가
경쟁금지 조약이 있는 탓에

43
00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:18.253
이를 공식적으로
제안할 수는 없습니다

44
00:02:18.254 --> 00:02:20.093
그렇기 때문에

45
00:02:20.094 --> 00:02:22.640
엘리엇 씨가
자진해서 오신다면

46
00:02:22.641 --> 00:02:27.095
5년 이내 백만장자가
되실 수 있어요

47
00:02:27.096 --> 00:02:29.096
어떻게 하실래요?

48
00:02:38.324 --> 00:02:39.606
좀 더...

49
00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.610
좀 더 생각해봐도 될까요?

50
00:02:48.784 --> 00:02:51.535
여러분, 자리 좀 비켜주시죠

51
00:02:51.587 --> 00:02:53.837
괜찮아요, 압니다

52
00:03:12.691 --> 00:03:14.892
알다시피

53
00:03:14.944 --> 00:03:19.146
이빌 사는 저를
임시 CTO로 임명했어요

54
00:03:19.198 --> 00:03:21.982
공식 지위가 되는데는
얼마 안걸릴 거에요

55
00:03:22.034 --> 00:03:26.564
제가 이 회사에서
가장 젊은 경영진이 되겠죠

56
00:03:27.206 --> 00:03:29.324
해커들한테 따로 전화해서

57
00:03:29.325 --> 00:03:31.408
감사인사라도 하고싶을
정도라니깐요

58
00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:33.628
한편으론, 음..

59
00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:35.997
뭐라고 하더라..

60
00:03:35.998 --> 00:03:38.999
어부지리랄까요?

61
00:03:55.317 --> 00:03:59.074
분기말까지 저희는

62
00:03:59.075 --> 00:04:01.188
네트워크를 개편하고

63
00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.858
보안 프로토콜을 통합할거에요

64
00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:06.765
저희는 모든 걸
내부적으로 관리할겁니다

65
00:04:06.766 --> 00:04:09.780
그말인 즉슨
올세이프를 포함한

66
00:04:09.832 --> 00:04:11.699
다른 계약 업체와
연을 끊게 되는거죠

67
00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.035
그렇게 되면, 알다시피
올세이프의 미래는

68
00:04:15.087 --> 00:04:17.038
끝났다고 할 수 있죠

69
00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:18.706
그 일이 일어나게 되면

70
00:04:18.707 --> 00:04:21.291
당신이 속한 곳으로
오기 바랍니다

71
00:04:21.343 --> 00:04:23.172
바로 여기죠

72
00:04:23.173 --> 00:04:25.884
중대한 결정이란거 알아요

73
00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.706
당신이 마지막 결정을
내리기 전에

74
00:04:29.707 --> 00:04:32.352
정보를 주고싶었을 뿐이에요

75
00:04:43.732 --> 00:04:46.648
저는 지금 있는 곳에
만족해요

76
00:05:11.447 --> 00:05:14.428
잘 생각해보세요

77
00:05:33.878 --> 00:05:37.896
MR. ROBOT

79
00:05:56.472 --> 00:05:58.972
이 번호로 연락하시면 됩니다

80
00:05:59.024 --> 00:06:02.547
저는 미스터 엑스라고 부르세요

81
00:06:04.813 --> 00:06:07.815
이봐요, 영화 JFK도 안봤어요?

82
00:06:07.816 --> 00:06:10.651
올리버 스톤 감독?

83
00:06:10.652 --> 00:06:13.070
썰렁한 반응은 처음이라
좀 당황스럽네요

84
00:06:13.122 --> 00:06:15.214
정말 좋은 영화니깐
꼭 보세요

85
00:06:15.215 --> 00:06:17.158
불법다운 하진 마시고요

86
00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:19.660
아무튼, 저는
서더랜드라고 부르세요

87
00:06:19.712 --> 00:06:23.164
마음의 준비가 되면
언제든지 연락 주세요

88
00:06:23.165 --> 00:06:25.666
저희는 항상
가까이 있습니다

89
00:06:36.078 --> 00:06:37.594
날짜를 지금 정하자

90
00:06:37.646 --> 00:06:39.096
- 싫어
- 이따 봐

91
00:06:39.148 --> 00:06:40.263
나 가야해, 고마워

92
00:06:40.315 --> 00:06:42.150
- 나 안 데려갈거야?
- 싫어

93
00:06:42.151 --> 00:06:44.519
- 정말 안 데려갈거야?
- 싫다니깐, 그만해

94
00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.688
- 너랑 같이 올라갈래
- 싫어

95
00:06:46.689 --> 00:06:48.271
다음에 하자
나 가야해

96
00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:56.863
- 괜찮아?
- 그냥 추근덕대는 거야

97
00:06:56.915 --> 00:07:01.451
눈치 없는 놈들은
정말 짜증나

98
00:07:05.507 --> 00:07:07.208
근데 너네 집
난방기도 고장났어?

99
00:07:07.209 --> 00:07:10.510
너무 뜨거워서
쪄죽을 것 같다니깐

100
00:07:11.597 --> 00:07:15.048
엘리엇, 괜찮아?
정신이 나가 보여

101
00:07:17.052 --> 00:07:19.803
혹시 지금 약 좀
더 살수 있을까?

102
00:07:19.804 --> 00:07:21.689
좀 이른 시간이지 않아?

103
00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:24.474
오늘은 좀 일탈하고 싶어서

104
00:07:24.526 --> 00:07:28.202
원칙주의자 씨한테
이런 모습을 볼 줄은 몰랐는데

105
00:07:28.203 --> 00:07:30.565
알겠어

106
00:07:30.566 --> 00:07:33.234
아, 맞다
다른 약이 다 떨어졌어

107
00:07:33.235 --> 00:07:36.070
괜찮아, 모르핀만 있음 돼

108
00:07:36.071 --> 00:07:38.239
*섭옥손 없이는
(아편 의존증 치료제)

109
00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.074
약 절대 주지 않기로
나랑 약속했잖아

110
00:07:40.075 --> 00:07:43.377
- 샤일라
- 안 돼, 엘리엇

111
00:07:43.378 --> 00:07:45.246
우리 약속했잖아

112
00:07:45.247 --> 00:07:47.617
약속은 중요해

113
00:07:54.575 --> 00:07:56.257
이번 한번만 봐줄게

114
00:07:56.258 --> 00:07:58.092
대신 해독제 없이는
과다복용하지 않기로 약속해

115
00:07:58.093 --> 00:08:01.929
이따 페르난도가
올 것 같거든

116
00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:03.764
내가 뭐라고 했지?

117
00:08:06.985 --> 00:08:08.268
알았어, 약속할게

118
00:08:18.831 --> 00:08:20.782
안녕, 여러분

119
00:08:20.783 --> 00:08:22.866
내가 당신을 잊은 줄 알았어?

120
00:08:22.918 --> 00:08:26.169
걱정마, 지금 당신이 필요해

121
00:08:29.174 --> 00:08:31.292
일해야 하거든

122
00:08:31.293 --> 00:08:33.461
타이렐 웰릭을 해킹하는게
복잡할거라 생각하겠지만

123
00:08:33.462 --> 00:08:35.712
사실은 엄청 쉬워

124
00:08:35.764 --> 00:08:37.799
이빌 사 메일 서버는 지난번 이후로
아직 아무 조치도 안했거든

125
00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:39.800
웰릭은 본인확인 2단계도
쓰지 않더라니깐

126
00:08:39.852 --> 00:08:41.803
비밀번호는 아내의
처녀적 이름에

127
00:08:41.804 --> 00:08:44.872
스웨덴 독립일
6월 6일 조합이군

128
00:08:44.873 --> 00:08:47.141
너무 간단해 보이지만

129
00:08:47.142 --> 00:08:50.143
이건 그냥 시도해보는거야

130
00:08:52.447 --> 00:08:54.447
이메일을 보니

131
00:08:57.452 --> 00:09:00.521
그의 삶은 행복하고
너무나 완벽하군

132
00:09:00.522 --> 00:09:03.124
이건 말이 안돼

133
00:09:03.125 --> 00:09:07.829
내가 해킹할 걸
예상하고 있었나?

134
00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:09.830
일부러 해킹하게 둔건가?

135
00:09:12.551 --> 00:09:15.051
모든 걸 지워야 겠어

136
00:10:09.466 --> 00:10:12.226
나도 알아, 평상시보다
더많이 하고 있는거

137
00:10:12.227 --> 00:10:14.482
계속 규칙을 깨고있네

138
00:10:14.483 --> 00:10:16.394
에이, 그래도
쉬는 날이잖아

139
00:10:54.269 --> 00:10:56.236
얼른

140
00:10:59.608 --> 00:11:02.443
멍멍아
너 여기서...

141
00:11:02.444 --> 00:11:05.161
여기서 볼일 봐야해

142
00:11:07.282 --> 00:11:11.452
쌀 거면 여기서 싸
알겠지?

143
00:11:11.453 --> 00:11:12.619
얼른

144
00:11:13.914 --> 00:11:16.116
넌 할수 있어

145
00:11:16.117 --> 00:11:18.315
넌 할수 있다고

146
00:11:44.736 --> 00:11:47.866
이빌 사 CTO 테리 콜비는...

147
00:11:47.867 --> 00:11:50.240
모두가 테리 콜비에
대해서 떠들어댄다

148
00:11:50.292 --> 00:11:55.329
티비마다 똑같은 뉴스가
계속 나온다

149
00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:57.331
어떻게 일상으로 돌아가지?

150
00:11:57.332 --> 00:11:59.333
일이 손에 잡히지 않는다

151
00:11:59.334 --> 00:12:01.836
미스터 로봇은
언제쯤 연락올까?

152
00:12:01.837 --> 00:12:04.005
뭘 기다리는 거지?

153
00:12:04.006 --> 00:12:07.257
설마 내가 아무 이유 없이
한 남자의 인생을 끝장낸건가?

154
00:12:07.309 --> 00:12:09.759
인사과에 얘기해서
자네 연봉을 인상할까 하네

155
00:12:09.811 --> 00:12:11.177
- 저는 괜찮아요
- 아니

156
00:12:11.229 --> 00:12:13.096
인상분을 받게

157
00:12:13.148 --> 00:12:17.351
큰 액수는 아니겠지만
내가 할 수 있는 최선이네

158
00:12:17.352 --> 00:12:18.685
엘리엇

159
00:12:18.737 --> 00:12:20.737
자네가 회사를 구한거야

160
00:12:23.992 --> 00:12:25.675
그럼 이제...

161
00:12:27.863 --> 00:12:31.281
왜 내게 DAT 파일이
있다고 말 안했나?

162
00:12:31.333 --> 00:12:33.909
회의에 들어가기 전에
나한테 말할 수도 있었잖나

163
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:36.063
하지만 그러지 않았지

164
00:12:36.064 --> 00:12:39.611
그 이유가 궁금하네

165
00:12:42.377 --> 00:12:45.616
당시에 제가 뭘
찾은건지 몰랐어요

166
00:12:45.617 --> 00:12:48.548
그저 무의미한
파일일 수 있으니깐요

167
00:12:49.518 --> 00:12:50.967
자네는 절대 단언하지 않잖아

168
00:12:51.019 --> 00:12:54.055
무언가 확실하기 전에는 말이야

169
00:12:54.056 --> 00:12:57.857
사장님이 저에 대해
잘못 생각한 걸지도요

170
00:12:59.861 --> 00:13:02.229
어쨌든 간에..

171
00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:05.733
현재 상황에선 자네가
그 누구보다 필요하네

172
00:13:05.734 --> 00:13:08.736
에프 소사이어티 해커가
다음에 또 무슨짓을 할지 누가 알겠어

173
00:13:08.737 --> 00:13:10.320
그가 뭐라고 한거지?

174
00:13:10.372 --> 00:13:13.407
- 뭐라고 하셨죠?
- 콜비랑 일한 놈들 말이야

175
00:13:13.408 --> 00:13:15.909
데이터 저장소에 무슨 정보가
있을지 다 꿰뚫고 있었지

176
00:13:15.961 --> 00:13:17.077
이빌 사는...

177
00:13:17.129 --> 00:13:19.662
무슨 말씀이시죠?

178
00:13:19.714 --> 00:13:21.582
새로운 국면을 맞았네

179
00:13:21.583 --> 00:13:23.583
자네가 이미
알고 있는 줄 알았는데

180
00:13:23.635 --> 00:13:25.920
그들이 결함을 찾아내
시스템 본체를 해킹했어

181
00:13:25.921 --> 00:13:29.256
테라바이트 수준의
이메일과 파일을 복제하고

182
00:13:29.257 --> 00:13:31.158
FBI가 콜비를 풀어주지 않으면

183
00:13:31.159 --> 00:13:33.343
정보를 모두 유출하겠다고
협박하고 있네

184
00:13:33.395 --> 00:13:36.396
오늘 아침에
비디오가 올라왔어

185
00:13:43.271 --> 00:13:45.187
안녕하신가, 이빌 주식회사

186
00:13:45.188 --> 00:13:46.838
우리는 에프 소사이어티다

187
00:13:46.839 --> 00:13:49.003
지난 몇 년동안
우리는 당신을 감시해왔다

188
00:13:49.004 --> 00:13:50.777
빈곤층에 대한
경제적 학대

189
00:13:50.829 --> 00:13:52.612
정부에 대한 비리

190
00:13:52.664 --> 00:13:55.782
무고한 시민을 죽이고선
은폐 공작행위까지

191
00:13:55.834 --> 00:13:57.785
모두 다 돈을 위해
한 짓이었지

192
00:13:57.786 --> 00:13:59.839
그게 바로 우리
에프 소사이어티가

193
00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:02.006
이빌 사에 사형선고를
내리는 이유다

194
00:14:02.007 --> 00:14:04.074
우리는 당신들을 혐오한다

195
00:14:04.075 --> 00:14:06.076
우리는 절대
타협하지 않을 것이다

196
00:14:06.077 --> 00:14:07.313
우리는 끝까지 갈 것이다

197
00:14:07.314 --> 00:14:11.241
흉물스러운 악의 촉수가
하나 하나 끊어질 때까지

198
00:14:11.242 --> 00:14:13.299
우리는 멈추지 않을 것이다

199
00:14:13.351 --> 00:14:15.635
우리는 자비를 베풀지 않는다

200
00:14:15.687 --> 00:14:18.305
이번 해킹은
마지막 경고이다

201
00:14:18.306 --> 00:14:21.978
우리의 요구를 받아들이면
당신을 파괴하지 않겠다

202
00:14:21.979 --> 00:14:24.561
첫째로, 불법적인 감옥에서

203
00:14:24.613 --> 00:14:27.148
우리의 지도자 테리 콜비를
당장 석방하라

204
00:14:27.149 --> 00:14:30.184
둘째, 더욱 악질적인
불법적인 빚의 감옥에서

205
00:14:30.185 --> 00:14:33.570
세상 모든 사람들을 석방하라

206
00:14:33.622 --> 00:14:36.157
세번째, 이빌 사를 해체하고

207
00:14:36.158 --> 00:14:39.826
모든 자산을
전 세계에 기부해라

208
00:14:39.878 --> 00:14:42.229
우리는 협상을
받지 않는다

209
00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:43.902
당신들이 존재하는 한

210
00:14:43.903 --> 00:14:46.332
사람들은 선택의 자유가
없다는 것을 알고 있다

211
00:14:46.384 --> 00:14:48.335
사람들은 깨어나고 있다

212
00:14:48.336 --> 00:14:51.172
더이상 당신의 경제적
노예로 있지 않을것이다

213
00:14:51.173 --> 00:14:55.008
요구를 받지 않는다면,
우리는 당신을 없앨 것이다

214
00:14:55.009 --> 00:14:56.843
경고를 받아들이도록

215
00:14:56.844 --> 00:14:59.047
에프 소사이어티

216
00:15:01.683 --> 00:15:02.982
다시 틀어주세요

217
00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:06.832
여보게들, 제 앨범이 나왔어요

218
00:15:06.833 --> 00:15:09.734
좋아요 20번만 눌러주시면
CD 공짜로 드릴게요

219
00:15:09.786 --> 00:15:12.070
느낌 있는 노래에요
제 장담해요

220
00:15:12.071 --> 00:15:13.405
공짜 CD라니깐요
트윗만 해주시면 돼요

221
00:15:13.406 --> 00:15:15.401
SNS로 홍보해주시면 됩니다

222
00:15:15.402 --> 00:15:19.170
이번 미팅을
조정하려 했는데...

223
00:15:19.171 --> 00:15:20.682
여어, 엘리엇!

224
00:15:20.683 --> 00:15:22.141
축하한다, 짜샤

225
00:15:22.142 --> 00:15:24.798
네 덕에 올세이프가
인터넷에 도배됐다고

226
00:15:24.799 --> 00:15:27.284
우리 축하 파티하는건 어때?

227
00:15:27.285 --> 00:15:29.287
모튼스에서 목요일날
4명짜리 식사쿠폰 있거든

228
00:15:29.288 --> 00:15:31.456
같이 가자했던
다른 커플이 안된다던데

229
00:15:31.457 --> 00:15:32.791
너는 어때? 생각없어?

230
00:15:32.792 --> 00:15:34.826
거기 스테이크 진짜 맛있어
3만원짜리인데...

231
00:15:34.827 --> 00:15:35.961
엘리엇은 별로
가고 싶어 하지 않을거야

232
00:15:35.962 --> 00:15:37.045
알겠어, 좋아

233
00:15:37.046 --> 00:15:39.631
가는거다? 좋아

234
00:15:39.632 --> 00:15:42.634
그럼 우리
더블 데이트로 안할래?

235
00:15:42.635 --> 00:15:44.052
너 여자친구
생겼다고 들었는데

236
00:15:44.053 --> 00:15:46.221
올리, 모르는 척 하라니깐

237
00:15:46.222 --> 00:15:47.638
엘리엇도 괜찮다잖아

238
00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:49.975
알겠어
근데 나 지금 가야겠다

239
00:15:49.976 --> 00:15:53.560
우리집 개가 자꾸 짖는다고
이웃집에서 뭐라 해서 말이야

240
00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:02.404
- 엘리엇이 개를 키운다고?
- 여보시게들

241
00:16:02.405 --> 00:16:03.488
잘 어울리는 한쌍이네요

242
00:16:03.489 --> 00:16:04.739
제가 새로 앨범을 냈어요

243
00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:06.241
랩이나 힙합 좋아하세요?

244
00:16:06.242 --> 00:16:08.576
엄청 시적이고 심오한
음악이거든요

245
00:16:08.577 --> 00:16:10.245
분명 여자친구가 좋아할거에요

246
00:16:10.246 --> 00:16:12.664
2주 넘게 여기서
이러시는거 알아요

247
00:16:12.665 --> 00:16:13.999
CD 받을테니깐

248
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.332
더이상 말걸지 마세요

249
00:16:15.384 --> 00:16:17.335
고마워요, 정말 고마워요

250
00:16:17.336 --> 00:16:19.503
음악 좋으면 트윗할게요
됐죠?

251
00:16:19.555 --> 00:16:21.423
48명밖에 팔로워가 없지만
뭐, 늘어날거에요

252
00:16:21.424 --> 00:16:23.008
물론이죠

253
00:16:23.009 --> 00:16:24.092
좋은 삘이 와요

254
00:16:24.093 --> 00:16:25.343
- 잘 가요
- 넵

255
00:16:25.344 --> 00:16:26.677
고마워요, 형님

256
00:16:26.729 --> 00:16:28.096
- 좋은 하루 되세요
- 당신도요

257
00:16:28.097 --> 00:16:29.431
정말 고마워요!
2번 트랙 꼭 들어봐요

258
00:16:29.432 --> 00:16:32.350
- 2번 트랙이요
- 알겠어요

259
00:16:32.351 --> 00:16:33.768
이건 계획과는 다르다

260
00:16:33.769 --> 00:16:36.071
정보 유출?
테리 콜비를 풀어달라고?

261
00:16:36.072 --> 00:16:37.855
이 모든건
말이 되지 않는다

262
00:16:37.907 --> 00:16:40.442
에프 소사이어티와
모든 연을 끊어야 한다

263
00:16:40.443 --> 00:16:41.860
거기서 나와야 해

264
00:16:41.861 --> 00:16:43.577
병가를 내고
당분간 잠수를 타야지

265
00:16:59.712 --> 00:17:02.714
젠장!
나 알몸이라고

266
00:17:02.715 --> 00:17:04.549
쳐다보지 마

267
00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:06.301
왜 우리집에서
샤워하고 있는거야

268
00:17:06.302 --> 00:17:08.386
널 기다리고 있었거든

269
00:17:08.387 --> 00:17:09.720
어제 온다고 했잖아

270
00:17:09.772 --> 00:17:12.222
- 벌써 잊은거야?
- 어디로 간다 했는데?

271
00:17:12.274 --> 00:17:14.274
걱정마, 모두들
나중에 올테니깐

272
00:17:20.649 --> 00:17:23.151
옷 좀 빌릴게

273
00:17:23.152 --> 00:17:26.704
내 원피스에 뭐가
묻어서 말이야

274
00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:30.836
바보야, 너 놀려본거야

275
00:17:30.837 --> 00:17:32.917
내 옷은 지금
세탁기에 있어

276
00:17:32.918 --> 00:17:35.108
그동안 니 옷좀 빌릴게

277
00:17:35.581 --> 00:17:37.332
그나저나

278
00:17:37.333 --> 00:17:39.834
니네 강아지가
침대에 오줌 쌌더라

279
00:17:39.835 --> 00:17:42.371
산책 좀 시켜

280
00:17:43.077 --> 00:17:46.091
샤일라, 플리퍼 좀
잠깐 맡아줘

281
00:17:46.092 --> 00:17:48.093
산책 시켜야 할거야

282
00:17:48.094 --> 00:17:49.928
아무데서나
자꾸 오줌을 싸네

283
00:17:49.929 --> 00:17:51.096
당연히 산책시켜야지

284
00:17:51.097 --> 00:17:52.597
얜 빌어먹을 강아지라고

285
00:17:52.598 --> 00:17:56.100
우리 가기 전에
아이스크림 좀 먹자

286
00:17:57.603 --> 00:18:00.438
곧 돌아올게

287
00:18:00.439 --> 00:18:03.440
- 너한테 신세졌다
- 아주 큰 신세인줄 알아

288
00:18:14.954 --> 00:18:17.188
어디 사는지
어떻게 알았죠?

289
00:18:17.189 --> 00:18:20.024
그걸 왜 모를거라 생각하는데?

290
00:18:20.025 --> 00:18:24.595
글쎄요. 저는 당신이
사는 곳을 모르거든요

291
00:18:26.549 --> 00:18:30.300
나는 지금 아무 곳에서도
살고 있지 않거든

292
00:18:30.352 --> 00:18:34.304
나랑 사귀던 녀석이
나한테 결혼하재, 미친

293
00:18:34.356 --> 00:18:37.058
병신도 그런 병신이 없지

294
00:18:37.059 --> 00:18:39.811
크게 한바탕 했더니
그 녀석이...

295
00:18:39.812 --> 00:18:41.713
지금 뭐하고 있는거지?

296
00:18:41.714 --> 00:18:44.148
저년은 정신이 나갔어

297
00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:46.317
돌아가서 기디언한테
모든걸 털어놓자

298
00:18:46.318 --> 00:18:47.569
그는 이해해줄거야

299
00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:48.903
내가 어떻게 해야하는지
알고 있겠지

300
00:18:48.904 --> 00:18:51.156
...그는 나를 잊게될거야

301
00:18:51.157 --> 00:18:52.574
영원한 사랑같은 개소리는

302
00:18:52.575 --> 00:18:55.577
더이상 안하게 되겠지

303
00:18:55.578 --> 00:18:57.494
내가 잠깐만 사라져있으면

304
00:18:57.546 --> 00:18:59.497
걔도 정신을 차리게 되는거지

305
00:18:59.498 --> 00:19:00.665
문이 닫힙니다

306
00:19:00.666 --> 00:19:03.251
그게 우리 사이야

307
00:19:03.252 --> 00:19:05.669
얼른 들어가!

308
00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:15.930
얘한테도 저들이 보이나?

309
00:19:15.931 --> 00:19:17.415
왜 그래?

310
00:19:17.416 --> 00:19:21.185
나는 서있는걸 좋아하거든

311
00:19:21.237 --> 00:19:25.190
반대 의견을 말하는건
사실 제일 힘든...

312
00:19:25.191 --> 00:19:28.859
타이렐이 이 사실을 알게되면?
그는 어떻게 할까?

313
00:19:28.911 --> 00:19:31.279
빌어먹을, 내가 감옥에 가거나

314
00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:34.031
죽게 되는건
계획에 전혀 없었다고

315
00:19:34.083 --> 00:19:37.634
...내가 거북이를 키우고 싶다니깐
그 녀석이 싫다면서...

316
00:19:38.014 --> 00:19:40.121
너한테 며칠 더
신세를 져야 할지도

317
00:19:40.122 --> 00:19:42.372
그래도 괜찮지?

318
00:19:42.424 --> 00:19:44.042
정말 그럴거야?

319
00:19:44.043 --> 00:19:46.377
알겠어. 모블리네 집에서
신세질게

320
00:19:46.378 --> 00:19:48.546
나도 강아지 싫어하니깐 뭐

321
00:19:48.547 --> 00:19:50.298
더군다나 똥오줌
못가리는 놈은 질색이야

322
00:19:50.299 --> 00:19:52.382
어떻게 그런 애를
데리고 살아?

323
00:19:52.434 --> 00:19:54.218
침대에서 냄새날텐데
잠은 어떻게 자?

324
00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:57.388
내가 지금 덫을 밟고 있다는
생각이 든다

325
00:19:57.389 --> 00:19:59.556
저 문을 지나치면
우리는 단숨에 죽을지도 몰라

326
00:19:59.608 --> 00:20:03.443
창고 안에서 무시무시한
일이 일어나고 있어

327
00:20:03.444 --> 00:20:05.312
무시무시하다고

328
00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:16.231
유명인 납셨네

329
00:20:21.037 --> 00:20:22.753
빌어먹을 오리들

330
00:20:25.508 --> 00:20:26.958
이봐, 안녕!

331
00:20:27.687 --> 00:20:28.960
앗, 미안

332
00:20:29.012 --> 00:20:30.712
괜찮아

333
00:20:30.713 --> 00:20:32.881
모두 네 덕이야

334
00:20:32.882 --> 00:20:33.965
정말 대단해

335
00:20:34.017 --> 00:20:35.133
자부심을 가져

336
00:20:35.134 --> 00:20:36.885
정말 대단한 걸 해냈어

337
00:20:36.886 --> 00:20:39.054
인사치례 다 끝났으면

338
00:20:39.055 --> 00:20:41.723
이제 계획 좀 들을까?

339
00:20:41.724 --> 00:20:43.141
스틸 산은 어떻게 됐지?

340
00:20:43.142 --> 00:20:44.526
내가 제대로 알고 있다면

341
00:20:44.527 --> 00:20:46.361
여기 회선들은
완전히 안전하지 않아

342
00:20:46.362 --> 00:20:48.069
콜비 프로젝트도
아직 끝나지 않았으니깐

343
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:49.131
진심으로요?

344
00:20:49.132 --> 00:20:50.418
몇 주나 됐다고요

345
00:20:50.419 --> 00:20:52.568
링크나 흔적들도
이제 처리됐을텐데

346
00:20:52.569 --> 00:20:54.853
회선은 깨끗해요, 보스
제가 장담하죠

347
00:20:54.854 --> 00:20:56.569
고마워

348
00:20:56.570 --> 00:20:59.375
하지만 더 안전하길 바란다면
로메로랑 제가 체크할게요

349
00:20:59.376 --> 00:21:01.693
좋았어!
훨씬 안심되는군

350
00:21:01.745 --> 00:21:04.912
난 저기서
생각 좀 정리하지

351
00:21:14.257 --> 00:21:15.707
저 여잔 뭐죠?

352
00:21:15.759 --> 00:21:17.626
달린은 복잡한 애야

353
00:21:17.627 --> 00:21:19.762
악성프로그램 코더가
다 그렇지

354
00:21:19.763 --> 00:21:22.046
저희 집에 있더라고요

355
00:21:22.047 --> 00:21:23.832
제가 사는델
어떻게 알고 있는거죠?

356
00:21:23.833 --> 00:21:25.501
쟤는 신경쓰지마

357
00:21:25.502 --> 00:21:27.391
끝없이 골치만
아파질 뿐이야

358
00:21:27.392 --> 00:21:30.472
프로젝트 다음 단계나
생각하자고

359
00:21:30.473 --> 00:21:34.265
코멧 알지?
*올바니의 천연가스 공장 회사야
(올바니: 뉴욕시의 주도)

360
00:21:36.146 --> 00:21:39.063
우린 그걸 날려버릴거야

361
00:21:39.115 --> 00:21:41.729
올바니를 왜...

362
00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:44.190
코멧의 공장은 스틸 산
바로 옆에 있죠

363
00:21:44.191 --> 00:21:45.988
스틸 산은 알다시피

364
00:21:45.989 --> 00:21:49.907
모든 기업의 신용 평가 서비스
데이터를 저장해 놓는 곳이지

365
00:21:49.959 --> 00:21:51.243
거기엔 우리의 친애하는...

366
00:21:51.244 --> 00:21:54.079
- 이빌 사도 있군요
- 정답이야

367
00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:56.582
그들의 백업 데이터를
없애려는 거네요

368
00:21:56.583 --> 00:21:58.834
이미 대비하고 있을지도 몰라요

369
00:21:58.835 --> 00:22:01.253
해킹 이후로
보안이 삼엄하다고요

370
00:22:01.254 --> 00:22:03.172
그런데 그들이
이미 범인을 잡았잖나?

371
00:22:03.173 --> 00:22:05.507
- 그렇지 않나?
- 아뇨

372
00:22:05.508 --> 00:22:08.010
- 타이렐 웰릭은 알아요
- 그들이 원하는 것만 알고있지

373
00:22:08.011 --> 00:22:10.095
그는 흔한 기업의 노예야

374
00:22:10.096 --> 00:22:12.481
우리가 유출한 데이터 덕에

375
00:22:12.482 --> 00:22:14.349
이빌 사 전체가 휘청거릴거야

376
00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:15.851
게다가 우리는 지원군이 있어

377
00:22:15.852 --> 00:22:17.853
구식의 인종차별주의자

378
00:22:17.854 --> 00:22:19.855
성차별주의자, 전체주의자까지

379
00:22:19.856 --> 00:22:21.773
이렇게 든든한 "주의자"들 덕에

380
00:22:21.825 --> 00:22:23.609
그들은 사태를
제대로 파악하지 못할거야

381
00:22:23.610 --> 00:22:25.777
게다가 콜비를 풀어달라
요구한건 가히 천재적이었지

382
00:22:25.778 --> 00:22:28.997
추적망이 분산되서
절대 우리를 찾지 못할거야

383
00:22:28.998 --> 00:22:31.867
트렌턴의 생각이었어

384
00:22:31.868 --> 00:22:34.526
순진해 보일지 몰라도
얼마나 날카로운지

385
00:22:34.527 --> 00:22:36.955
알라신은 참 위대하다니깐

386
00:22:36.956 --> 00:22:38.540
그동안 너는

387
00:22:38.541 --> 00:22:41.043
올세이프에서 보안 허가를 받아
코멧 공장을 해킹하는거야

388
00:22:41.044 --> 00:22:45.380
압력을 높이고
가스 송유관을 폭발시켜

389
00:22:45.381 --> 00:22:47.216
스틸 산을 이빌 사의
영혼과 함꼐

390
00:22:47.217 --> 00:22:49.217
저세상으로 날려버리는 거야

391
00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:56.641
저들도 이걸 다 알아요?

392
00:22:56.693 --> 00:22:58.559
너한테 처음 말하는거야

393
00:23:01.231 --> 00:23:03.232
근로자들은요?

394
00:23:03.233 --> 00:23:05.478
공장 근처에 있는 사람들..

395
00:23:05.479 --> 00:23:07.108
모두 다 죽는거에요?

396
00:23:07.109 --> 00:23:11.239
미리 알람을 울릴거야
그들은 걱정마

397
00:23:13.576 --> 00:23:15.410
당신은 가스 송유관을
폭파시키는거에요

398
00:23:15.411 --> 00:23:17.579
세상은 위험한 곳이야

399
00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:19.164
악의 무리 때문에
그런것이 아니라

400
00:23:19.165 --> 00:23:21.332
방관하고 아무짓도
안하는 사람들 때문이지

401
00:23:21.384 --> 00:23:22.584
이건 전쟁이라고

402
00:23:22.585 --> 00:23:24.752
몇몇은 죽겠지
어쩔 수 없는 일이야

403
00:23:26.339 --> 00:23:28.807
송유관을 폭파시키고 나면

404
00:23:28.808 --> 00:23:31.843
달린의 바이러스가
국가 데이터 센터로 침투할거야

405
00:23:31.895 --> 00:23:34.997
네가 그걸 도와줄거고

406
00:23:35.765 --> 00:23:39.322
중국의 동부 데이터
백업센터도 날려버릴거야

407
00:23:39.323 --> 00:23:41.687
*다크아미가 도와준데

408
00:23:41.688 --> 00:23:44.843
*다크아미라뇨?
('어노니머스'같은 가상의 국제 해킹그룹)

409
00:23:44.844 --> 00:23:46.357
그들은 체계가 없어요
아무나 해킹한다고요

410
00:23:46.409 --> 00:23:48.277
테러리스트, 북한, 이란, 러시아까지

411
00:23:48.278 --> 00:23:49.778
그 말인즉슨
누구 못지 않게

412
00:23:49.779 --> 00:23:53.532
미국 자본주의도
싫어한다는거야

413
00:23:53.533 --> 00:23:56.131
마지막으로,
이것 역시 중요해

414
00:23:56.132 --> 00:23:58.035
스틸 산

415
00:23:58.087 --> 00:24:00.530
해커의 딜레마지

416
00:24:00.531 --> 00:24:05.209
오프라인 데이터를
어떻게 해킹할 수 있는가

417
00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:13.401
전 아무도
죽이지 않을거에요

418
00:24:15.388 --> 00:24:17.536
엘리엇, 대답해봐

419
00:24:17.537 --> 00:24:19.640
자네는 0인가 1인가?

420
00:24:21.277 --> 00:24:22.978
스스로에게 물어보게

421
00:24:22.979 --> 00:24:25.147
자네는 예스인가 노인가?

422
00:24:25.148 --> 00:24:27.982
자네는 행동하겠나, 방관하겠나?

423
00:24:30.987 --> 00:24:35.693
아저씨, 컴퓨터 모니터를
너무 오래 봤나봐요

424
00:24:35.694 --> 00:24:38.077
삶은 그렇게 이분법적으로
나뉘지 않아요

425
00:24:38.078 --> 00:24:39.464
과연 그럴까?

426
00:24:39.465 --> 00:24:41.799
물론 회색지대도 있겠지

427
00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:44.081
하지만 자세히 살펴봐

428
00:24:44.082 --> 00:24:48.085
모든 선택의 중심에는
0과 1이 존재해

429
00:24:48.137 --> 00:24:51.256
행동하겠는가
아무것도 하지 않겠는가

430
00:24:51.257 --> 00:24:53.842
저 문을 나가면, 아무것도
하지 않기로 결정한거야

431
00:24:53.843 --> 00:24:57.679
'노'라고 대답하는 거지
넌 떠나는거야

432
00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:01.016
그렇게 되면, 넌 더이상
여기에 속하지 않아

433
00:25:01.017 --> 00:25:03.936
넌 0이 되는거야

434
00:25:03.937 --> 00:25:05.948
하지만 여기에 머문다면

435
00:25:05.949 --> 00:25:08.773
세상을 바꾸고 싶다면..

436
00:25:08.825 --> 00:25:10.609
너는 '예스'가 되는거야

437
00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:13.778
1이 되는거야

438
00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:15.947
그럼 다시 묻겠네

439
00:25:15.999 --> 00:25:19.284
자네는 1인가 0인가?

440
00:25:19.285 --> 00:25:21.452
저 때문에 무고한 남자가
감옥에 갔어요

441
00:25:21.504 --> 00:25:23.739
한두 살 먹은 어린애도
아니고, 왜 그래?

442
00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:26.310
콜비랑은 상관 없는 일이잖아!

443
00:25:29.308 --> 00:25:31.546
내 혁명에 관한 것도 아니야

444
00:25:31.547 --> 00:25:33.941
이건 너한테
더 중요한 일이지

445
00:25:33.942 --> 00:25:35.481
이건 저 개자식들 때문에

446
00:25:35.482 --> 00:25:38.000
아버지가 천천히 죽어갈때
자네의 바람에 관한 거야

447
00:25:38.001 --> 00:25:40.389
넌 그가 무언가 하길 바랬어
하지만 그는 그러지 않았지

448
00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:42.380
그가 0이었기 때문이야

449
00:25:42.381 --> 00:25:44.426
네가 지금 그러는 것처럼

450
00:25:46.229 --> 00:25:48.229
지랄 마

451
00:25:51.434 --> 00:25:54.268
또 사라지는거야?

452
00:25:56.272 --> 00:25:59.406
난 아무도 안 죽일거야
여기서 나는 빼줘

453
00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:03.861
넌 도망칠 수 없어

454
00:26:03.913 --> 00:26:05.280
네가 있던 없던
우리는 계속할거야

455
00:26:05.281 --> 00:26:07.531
하지만 넌 이미
여기에 가담했다고!

456
00:26:07.583 --> 00:26:10.752
멍청한 네 후드가
퍽이나 널 보호해주겠다!

457
00:26:10.753 --> 00:26:12.287
이건 실수야

458
00:26:12.288 --> 00:26:13.955
그들을 고발해야 해

459
00:26:13.956 --> 00:26:16.291
나도 엮이게 되려나?
젠장, 여자애 말이 맞아

460
00:26:16.292 --> 00:26:18.960
나도 과실이 있어
아니, 우리는 과실이 있어

461
00:26:18.961 --> 00:26:22.096
당신도 나랑 가담했으니
같이 해결책을 생각하자

462
00:26:26.908 --> 00:26:28.908
샤일라?

463
00:26:33.881 --> 00:26:35.631
샤일라, 문 좀 열어줘

464
00:26:36.067 --> 00:26:38.317
어서 와

465
00:26:38.369 --> 00:26:40.903
뭐 도와줄까?

466
00:26:43.374 --> 00:26:46.993
샤일라 좀 보러 왔는데

467
00:26:46.994 --> 00:26:48.911
어머, 그래라

468
00:26:48.963 --> 00:26:50.963
지금 욕조에 있어

469
00:26:55.169 --> 00:26:56.836
샤일라

470
00:26:56.837 --> 00:26:58.837
금방 나올거야

471
00:27:00.742 --> 00:27:03.859
앉아서 기다려도 돼

472
00:27:03.911 --> 00:27:06.779
샤일라가 괜찮은지
확인해야 할 것 같은데

473
00:27:09.334 --> 00:27:13.202
웃기는 놈이네
너 마음에 든다

474
00:27:13.254 --> 00:27:15.372
무례하게 굴지 말라고

475
00:27:15.373 --> 00:27:18.207
앉아서 기다리지

476
00:27:36.027 --> 00:27:38.561
사양할게

477
00:27:41.566 --> 00:27:43.650
너 이것만 하는구나

478
00:27:43.651 --> 00:27:47.570
약하면서 해독제도 같이 쓰는
놈은 너가 처음이다

479
00:27:47.622 --> 00:27:49.822
영리해

480
00:27:49.874 --> 00:27:52.658
네가 중독자가 아니라고
여길 수도 있겠어

481
00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:55.379
이런, 병신같은

482
00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:57.681
내 소개를 안했네
나는 페르난...

483
00:27:57.682 --> 00:27:59.683
페르난도 베라
샤일라의 공급자이다

484
00:27:59.684 --> 00:28:01.852
내가 해킹한 놈들 중
가장 최악인 자식이다

485
00:28:01.853 --> 00:28:05.555
녀석의 비밀번호?
"좆이나 빨아 6969"

486
00:28:05.556 --> 00:28:09.159
포르노와 웹캠에
거금을 낭비하는건 물론이거니와

487
00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:12.729
이메일, 페이스북, 트위터로
모든 마약거래를 한다

488
00:28:12.730 --> 00:28:15.265
경찰이 놈을 아직도
잡지 못하는 것은 이해가 안간다

489
00:28:15.266 --> 00:28:17.033
뇌세포가 하나라도 있으면

490
00:28:17.034 --> 00:28:19.536
갱의 가장 쉬운 코드를
깰수 있을 텐데

491
00:28:19.537 --> 00:28:21.688
그걸 코드라고
부를 수 있다면 말이다

492
00:28:21.689 --> 00:28:25.375
놈의 트위터와 연관된
기사를 찾아보니

493
00:28:25.376 --> 00:28:29.112
나는 과자와 또각이가
총을 의미함을 깨달았다

494
00:28:29.113 --> 00:28:32.082
음식, 조개, 가스는
총알을 의미한다

495
00:28:32.083 --> 00:28:34.885
일찍 꿈나라로 가다

496
00:28:34.886 --> 00:28:37.053
이 궁극적인 표현은
직접적인 연관은 못 찾았지만

497
00:28:37.054 --> 00:28:38.922
총과 총알을 더하면

498
00:28:38.923 --> 00:28:41.057
그 결과가 무엇일지
뻔하지 않겠는가

499
00:28:41.058 --> 00:28:42.592
놈을 고발할까 생각도 해보았지만

500
00:28:42.593 --> 00:28:44.761
그는 샤일라의 유일한 공급책이다

501
00:28:44.762 --> 00:28:47.063
내가 그를 신고하면
나는 내 약들을 잃는다

502
00:28:47.064 --> 00:28:50.400
지금 이 상황에선
난 약 없이는 버틸 수 없다

503
00:28:50.401 --> 00:28:53.069
알아들었지?

504
00:28:53.070 --> 00:28:55.238
어쨌던 말야

505
00:28:55.239 --> 00:28:58.442
걱정하지 말라고

506
00:28:58.443 --> 00:29:00.575
너 얘기도 해봐

507
00:29:01.725 --> 00:29:03.446
이름이 뭐야?

508
00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:07.149
엘리엇

509
00:29:07.201 --> 00:29:08.985
무슨 의미야?

510
00:29:08.986 --> 00:29:11.822
뭐야 설마
검색도 안해봤어?

511
00:29:11.823 --> 00:29:13.390
꼭 해보라고

512
00:29:13.391 --> 00:29:15.659
이름의 의미는
엄청 중요하다고

513
00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:18.928
샤일라는 괜찮아!
신경쓰지 말라니깐!

514
00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:24.734
날 믿어

515
00:29:24.735 --> 00:29:27.411
내가 잘 처리했어

516
00:29:32.243 --> 00:29:34.511
널 보니깐
내가 어렸을 때가 생각나네

517
00:29:34.512 --> 00:29:36.613
항상 우울하고 음침했지

518
00:29:36.614 --> 00:29:40.584
자살 시도도 몇번 했다니깐

519
00:29:40.585 --> 00:29:42.786
근데 매번 실패했어

520
00:29:42.787 --> 00:29:45.414
생물학에 젬병인가봐

521
00:29:46.156 --> 00:29:49.125
내가 너무 싫어
여전히 그래

522
00:29:49.126 --> 00:29:52.828
오랫동안 그게
내 단점이라 생각했지

523
00:29:58.669 --> 00:30:02.439
하지만 지금은
내 강점이라고 생각해

524
00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:05.342
사람들은 돌아다녀
혐오가 뭔지 모르는 것처럼

525
00:30:05.343 --> 00:30:09.779
스스로를
혐오하기 전까진 그러겠지

526
00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:12.315
내말은..

527
00:30:12.316 --> 00:30:15.184
진심으로 자신을
혐오하는거 말이야

528
00:30:15.819 --> 00:30:17.786
그게 바로 힘이야

529
00:30:28.850 --> 00:30:33.277
넌 내가 무섭지 않나봐?

530
00:30:34.906 --> 00:30:36.907
다행이야

531
00:30:36.908 --> 00:30:39.625
너랑 친구 먹는데
시간낭비한게 아니니깐

532
00:30:41.921 --> 00:30:44.030
이거 안필요하지 그치?

533
00:30:44.082 --> 00:30:48.618
너같이 용기있는 사람은
해독약 없이도 견딜 수 있어

534
00:30:48.670 --> 00:30:52.783
사실 네 덕에 오늘
내가 샤일라를 만났거든

535
00:30:52.784 --> 00:30:56.293
모든 걸 취급하는 새끼는
나뿐이니깐

536
00:30:56.294 --> 00:30:58.762
너의 귀중한 섭옥손까지
포함해서 말이야

537
00:30:58.763 --> 00:31:01.863
한편으론 너한테
고맙다고 해야겠는걸

538
00:31:01.864 --> 00:31:04.268
네가 날 그녀에게
데려온거니깐 말야

539
00:31:04.269 --> 00:31:07.219
너의 별은 나와 함께
궤도를 돌고있다고

540
00:31:07.272 --> 00:31:10.896
내 삶의 사랑을
가져다주면서 말이지

541
00:31:10.897 --> 00:31:14.212
이거, 우리가
여기에 있는거?

542
00:31:14.213 --> 00:31:16.729
그건 모두..

543
00:31:16.781 --> 00:31:19.232
아름다운 의미를
지니고 있는거야

544
00:31:19.233 --> 00:31:20.956
하지만 착각하지 말라고

545
00:31:20.957 --> 00:31:24.270
저 안에 있는 여자는
내 꺼야

546
00:31:25.256 --> 00:31:27.924
샤일라 없이는
어떻게 살지 모르겠어

547
00:31:27.925 --> 00:31:31.757
네가 그녀와 무슨
관계인지는 모르지만

548
00:31:31.758 --> 00:31:35.827
우리는 이제 친구니깐..

549
00:31:35.828 --> 00:31:38.935
이 경계를 지켜주길 바랄게

550
00:31:38.936 --> 00:31:40.936
우리 통한거지?

551
00:31:50.898 --> 00:31:53.767
오늘 아침에 만난 자식도
너랑 똑같이 쳐다보더라

552
00:31:53.768 --> 00:31:55.936
내가 말하고 싶은건

553
00:31:55.937 --> 00:31:58.654
무서워하는게 때로는
더 현명할 수도 있단거야

554
00:32:00.825 --> 00:32:02.825
어쩌면 멍청할수도 있고

555
00:32:08.499 --> 00:32:09.866
샤일라?

556
00:32:09.867 --> 00:32:11.335
자물쇠 따기

557
00:32:11.336 --> 00:32:12.919
해커들이 가장 좋아하는 스포츠다

558
00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:14.338
뚫기에 가장 완벽한 시스템이자

559
00:32:14.339 --> 00:32:16.288
가상현실과는 다르게

560
00:32:16.341 --> 00:32:18.207
자물쇠를 따면
직접 느낄 수 있기 때문이다

561
00:32:18.259 --> 00:32:19.675
직접 볼 수 있고
들을 수 있다

562
00:32:26.134 --> 00:32:27.954
샤일라

563
00:32:32.403 --> 00:32:35.338
샤일라, 정신차려

564
00:32:38.529 --> 00:32:41.148
무슨 일이야?

565
00:32:41.149 --> 00:32:44.234
괜찮아?

566
00:32:44.235 --> 00:32:46.403
왜 깡패놈이
너네집에 있는거야?

567
00:32:46.404 --> 00:32:48.237
나 왜 욕조에 있지?

568
00:32:52.619 --> 00:32:55.944
기억이 안나...
네 약이 필요하다고 말했어

569
00:32:55.945 --> 00:32:59.300
걔가 우리집에 왔고
약을 같이 했어

570
00:33:00.727 --> 00:33:02.461
놈이랑 섹스한건 기억나?

571
00:33:02.462 --> 00:33:05.531
뭐? 아니

572
00:33:05.532 --> 00:33:07.500
하지만 그는 분명히 했다

573
00:33:07.501 --> 00:33:08.834
알겠어, 가자

574
00:33:08.835 --> 00:33:10.903
- 지갑 챙겨, 신분증이랑..
- 그만 해

575
00:33:10.904 --> 00:33:14.507
난 어디도 안가

576
00:33:14.508 --> 00:33:15.975
무슨 말이야?

577
00:33:15.976 --> 00:33:18.076
놈이 이대로 관둘것 같아?

578
00:33:19.526 --> 00:33:21.948
걔한테 다시 돌아가면 안돼
나 약 없어도 돼

579
00:33:21.949 --> 00:33:24.950
- 다른 사람 찾으면 되잖아
- 그럴 수 없어

580
00:33:28.789 --> 00:33:32.692
베라가 정말 후하게
챙겨준단 말이야

581
00:33:32.693 --> 00:33:34.527
나 돈도 꽤 많이 벌어

582
00:33:34.528 --> 00:33:36.329
또 시작이다

583
00:33:36.330 --> 00:33:38.331
우리를 지배하는
보이지 않는 손

584
00:33:38.332 --> 00:33:41.334
고통의 한계점을 지나도
따를 수밖에 없게 만든다

585
00:33:41.335 --> 00:33:44.537
이번이 끝이 아닐거야

586
00:33:44.538 --> 00:33:46.505
놈이 또 그러면?

587
00:33:46.506 --> 00:33:49.849
가만히 있는다고
약속해줄래?

588
00:33:49.850 --> 00:33:52.111
나 진지해, 엘리엇

589
00:33:52.112 --> 00:33:55.114
내가 할 수 있는 건
아무것도 없는 걸

590
00:33:55.115 --> 00:33:57.382
난 선택권이 없어

591
00:33:59.219 --> 00:34:00.553
엘리엇

592
00:34:00.554 --> 00:34:03.455
오늘 밤
내 옆에 있어줄래?

593
00:34:08.061 --> 00:34:09.862
선택

594
00:34:09.863 --> 00:34:12.131
미스터 로봇이 맞을지도 모른다

595
00:34:12.132 --> 00:34:16.202
모든게 삶의
예스와 노에 대한 것이다

596
00:34:16.203 --> 00:34:19.905
우리가 그것을 결정하는가
그것이 우리를 결정하는가?

597
00:34:19.906 --> 00:34:22.241
페르난도 베라
나는 그를 없앨 것이다

598
00:34:22.242 --> 00:34:24.410
내 마약 공급책을 없앨 것이다

599
00:34:24.411 --> 00:34:26.212
나는 모르핀을 없앨 것이다

600
00:34:26.213 --> 00:34:29.255
내 안의 고통이 욱씬거린다

601
00:34:29.256 --> 00:34:31.484
다른 공급책은
얼마든지 찾을 수 있다

602
00:34:31.485 --> 00:34:34.553
하지만 베라가 말했듯
어떤 놈도 섭옥손을 취급하진 않는다

603
00:34:34.554 --> 00:34:36.989
디지털로 처방전을
위조하면 되지만

604
00:34:36.990 --> 00:34:39.992
약국들은 이런 걸 막기위해
엄청난 돈을 쓴다

605
00:34:39.993 --> 00:34:42.327
대부분이 종이 처방전만 받는다

606
00:34:42.379 --> 00:34:44.830
계속 합법적으로
약을 받는건 비현실적이다

607
00:34:44.831 --> 00:34:46.882
중독자가 되는 것 또한 그렇다

608
00:34:46.883 --> 00:34:49.031
마약 치료제를 끊거나

609
00:34:49.032 --> 00:34:51.141
베라를 계속 보거나
둘 중 하나인거다

610
00:34:51.142 --> 00:34:53.889
당신이 무슨 생각하는지 안다
답이 너무 뻔하지

611
00:34:53.890 --> 00:34:56.341
베라는 샤일라와 잘 수는 있지만

612
00:34:56.342 --> 00:34:58.471
강간은 용납할 수 없다

613
00:35:01.932 --> 00:35:05.518
샤일라처럼, 그는
내게 선택의 여지를 주지 않는군

614
00:35:05.519 --> 00:35:08.520
그는 더이상 존재해서는 안된다

615
00:35:20.534 --> 00:35:24.536
지금 어떤 기분인지부터 말해봐요

616
00:35:27.734 --> 00:35:30.449
안 좋아요

617
00:35:30.450 --> 00:35:33.584
뭐가 안좋죠?

618
00:35:34.396 --> 00:35:35.880
모든게 다요

619
00:35:37.884 --> 00:35:40.769
더 자세히 말해주실래요?

620
00:35:45.152 --> 00:35:49.125
모든걸 통제하고 있는지
어떻게 알수 있죠?

621
00:35:50.503 --> 00:35:52.779
우리가 처한 상황에서

622
00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:55.259
최선의 선택지를
고르지 않으면

623
00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:57.174
그걸로 끝인거에요

624
00:35:57.175 --> 00:36:01.407
두가지 선택지 사이에
계속해서 고민하죠

625
00:36:01.408 --> 00:36:05.327
대기실에 걸린
두 폭의 그림처럼요

626
00:36:05.328 --> 00:36:08.773
코카콜라인가, 펩시인가

627
00:36:09.431 --> 00:36:12.918
맥도날드인가, 버거킹인가

628
00:36:12.919 --> 00:36:16.751
현대인가, 혼다인가

629
00:36:20.631 --> 00:36:24.938
참 경계가 모호해요
그렇지 않나요?

630
00:36:24.939 --> 00:36:27.991
초점에서 벗어나 보면

631
00:36:27.992 --> 00:36:31.003
모두 선택의 허상인거에요

632
00:36:31.004 --> 00:36:34.206
대다수 사람들는 자신의 케이블이나

633
00:36:34.207 --> 00:36:37.610
가스, 전기회사조차 못 고르죠

634
00:36:37.611 --> 00:36:41.591
어떤 물을 마실지
어떤 보험에 가입할지도요

635
00:36:41.592 --> 00:36:45.284
우리가 선택할 수 있다한들
그게 무슨 소용이 있나요?

636
00:36:45.285 --> 00:36:48.330
선택지가
블루크로스와 블루실드라면

637
00:36:48.331 --> 00:36:51.005
빌어먹을, 무슨 의미가 있죠?

638
00:36:55.953 --> 00:37:00.305
그들은 결과적으로
똑같지 않나요?

639
00:37:01.134 --> 00:37:03.018
아뇨

640
00:37:03.019 --> 00:37:06.851
우리의 선택은
이미 예전부터

641
00:37:06.852 --> 00:37:10.207
결정이 되어있는 거에요

642
00:37:10.208 --> 00:37:13.478
엘리엇 씨가 무기력하게
느낀다니 유감이에요

643
00:37:15.482 --> 00:37:19.329
저는 제가 좋은 일을
하는 줄 알았어요

644
00:37:20.775 --> 00:37:24.325
저는 한 프로젝트의...
멤버였죠

645
00:37:25.249 --> 00:37:29.327
무언가 의미있는 일을
한다고 생각했거든요

646
00:37:33.917 --> 00:37:38.670
- 지금은 어떠신데요?
- 지금은..

647
00:37:38.671 --> 00:37:41.340
모든 게 다
실수라고 생각해요

648
00:37:41.341 --> 00:37:43.759
다른 모든 것처럼요

649
00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:47.604
무슨 의미가 있겠어요

650
00:37:48.512 --> 00:37:52.017
당신은 아무것도
안하는 게 차라리 나아요

651
00:37:52.018 --> 00:37:55.440
아무것도 안하는게
차라리 나아요

652
00:37:55.441 --> 00:37:57.690
전에도 이 문제를 얘기했어요

653
00:37:57.691 --> 00:38:00.693
엘리엇씨가 아무것도 할 수
없다는 느낌이 든다는 문제요

654
00:38:00.694 --> 00:38:02.694
기억하세요?

655
00:38:05.582 --> 00:38:08.367
엘리엇씨 아버님에 대해
얘기했을 때에요

656
00:38:08.368 --> 00:38:10.869
아버지가 암에 걸렸을 때

657
00:38:10.870 --> 00:38:13.539
아무것도 안하기로
결정한 걸 얘기했죠

658
00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:15.124
엘리엇 씨는 아버지께

659
00:38:15.125 --> 00:38:16.709
병을 유발시킨 회사와
싸워야 한다고 말했어요

660
00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:18.544
아버지도 사람들에게
알렸을 수도 있어요

661
00:38:18.545 --> 00:38:22.214
더 좋은 치료를
받을 수도 있었겠죠

662
00:38:22.215 --> 00:38:25.768
하지만 엘리엇씨 아버지는
아무것도 안하셨죠

663
00:38:25.769 --> 00:38:28.783
어쩌면 아버님이
지금 엘리엇씨가 느끼는 것과

664
00:38:28.784 --> 00:38:31.183
똑같은 감정을
느끼셨을지 몰라요

665
00:38:31.184 --> 00:38:34.058
그래봤자, 누구 말마따나
이게 다 무슨 소용이죠?

666
00:38:34.110 --> 00:38:36.312
- 그건 달라요
- 여기서 다른점은

667
00:38:36.313 --> 00:38:39.231
엘리엇, 당신은
선택의 여지가 있다는 거에요

668
00:38:39.232 --> 00:38:41.170
그게 당신이 가진 힘이에요

669
00:38:41.171 --> 00:38:43.126
당신은 통제할 수 있어요

670
00:38:43.127 --> 00:38:46.913
삶이 당신을 이끄는대로
끌려가지 않아도 돼요

671
00:38:46.914 --> 00:38:48.740
말해봐요

672
00:38:48.741 --> 00:38:51.660
도대체 무슨 일인거죠?

673
00:38:51.661 --> 00:38:54.245
저한테 계속 숨기면
당신을 도와줄 수 없어요

674
00:38:54.246 --> 00:38:55.797
닥쳐요!

675
00:38:58.835 --> 00:39:00.335
시끄러워!

676
00:39:03.146 --> 00:39:05.090
눈이 피곤에 찌들었네요

677
00:39:05.091 --> 00:39:06.925
소리치고 있고요
신경과민이에요

678
00:39:06.926 --> 00:39:09.011
지난 몇달 동안 엘리엇씨가

679
00:39:09.012 --> 00:39:14.350
다시 예전 습관으로
되돌아가는걸 지켜봐왔어요

680
00:39:14.351 --> 00:39:17.349
도 대 체
무슨 일이냐고요!

681
00:40:16.212 --> 00:40:17.996
여전히 전화 안받네

682
00:40:17.997 --> 00:40:22.333
엘리엇한테 내일
물어보면 되잖아

683
00:40:22.385 --> 00:40:24.586
매번 이걸 재생하려고 하면

684
00:40:24.587 --> 00:40:28.006
컴퓨터가 멈추고
CD를 뱉어내

685
00:40:28.007 --> 00:40:31.093
걔 요즘 상태가 안좋아

686
00:40:31.094 --> 00:40:34.178
오늘 완전 딴사람 같았다고

687
00:40:39.176 --> 00:40:42.455
오늘 밤 어때?
-스텔라-

688
00:40:44.570 --> 00:40:46.488
알겠어. 이따 전화할게
자기야 뭐라고 말했어?

689
00:40:46.489 --> 00:40:48.193
알겠어. 이따 전화할게
뭔가 잘못됐다고

690
00:40:48.194 --> 00:40:49.778
걔네집에 가볼까?

691
00:40:51.763 --> 00:40:54.199
괜찮은지 얼굴 좀 보게

692
00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:56.685
자기야, 걱정하지마

693
00:40:59.539 --> 00:41:01.123
엘리엇은 항상
이상하게 굴었잖아

694
00:41:01.124 --> 00:41:05.429
걱정된단 말이야

695
00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:07.666
그런데 말야

696
00:41:07.667 --> 00:41:10.261
애리조나 친구
프레드 기억나?

697
00:41:10.262 --> 00:41:13.385
한잔 하자는데

698
00:41:13.386 --> 00:41:15.636
금방 올게

699
00:41:16.697 --> 00:41:18.272
알겠어

700
00:42:01.022 --> 00:42:03.302
성공했습니다

701
00:42:29.865 --> 00:42:32.854
뜨거운 열정과 갈망

702
00:42:32.855 --> 00:42:35.652
두 사람은 그렇게 강렬한 사랑..

703
00:42:35.704 --> 00:42:40.073
가까움, 연결된 기분을
느껴본 적이 없었다

704
00:42:40.625 --> 00:42:43.210
- 다른 방법은 찾으셨...
- 조용!

705
00:42:43.211 --> 00:42:45.211
여기 앉게

706
00:42:54.789 --> 00:42:58.107
송유관을 폭파하지 않고
해킹할 수 있어요

707
00:42:58.108 --> 00:43:00.845
엘리엇, 우리 아직
화해 안 했어

708
00:43:00.846 --> 00:43:02.958
문을 박차고 나간거 기억안나?

709
00:43:02.959 --> 00:43:04.171
그랬죠

710
00:43:04.172 --> 00:43:06.066
내가 말했을텐데
문을 나가는 순간부터

711
00:43:06.067 --> 00:43:08.786
넌 더이상 우리 멤버가
아니라고 말이야

712
00:43:08.787 --> 00:43:11.021
저한테 계획이 있어요

713
00:43:11.022 --> 00:43:13.257
널 지지해주길 바라면

714
00:43:13.258 --> 00:43:16.093
넌 나한테 빚을 지는거야

715
00:43:16.094 --> 00:43:18.012
왜냐면 넌 그냥 떠났거든

716
00:43:18.013 --> 00:43:19.962
빚 같은 거
안 믿는 줄 알았는데요

717
00:43:19.963 --> 00:43:22.015
아니, 난 빚을 믿어

718
00:43:22.067 --> 00:43:24.434
빚을 없애야 한다고 믿지

719
00:43:28.437 --> 00:43:30.633
제가 어떻게 하길 바래요?

720
00:43:33.195 --> 00:43:36.030
네 아버지에 대해 말해줘

721
00:43:36.031 --> 00:43:38.282
당신은 제 머릿속으로
들어올 수 없어요

722
00:43:38.283 --> 00:43:40.744
당신의 사이비 연설은
안먹힌다고요

723
00:43:40.745 --> 00:43:42.535
그가 어떻게 죽었는지 말해봐

724
00:43:42.587 --> 00:43:44.037
왜요?

725
00:43:44.089 --> 00:43:46.206
당신은 이미 답을
알고 있는 것 같은데요

726
00:43:46.258 --> 00:43:48.675
자네한테서 직접 듣고싶네

727
00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:57.134
제가 이걸 하면...

728
00:43:57.135 --> 00:43:58.836
우리는 은신처로 돌아가

729
00:43:58.837 --> 00:44:01.054
계획에 대해 얘기하는거죠?

730
00:44:15.569 --> 00:44:18.525
아저씨가 무슨 얘길 듣고
싶은건지 모르겠네요

731
00:44:18.526 --> 00:44:20.632
아빠랑 저는 엄청 친했어요

732
00:44:20.633 --> 00:44:22.942
제 가장 친한 친구셨죠

733
00:44:22.997 --> 00:44:26.780
아버지는 이빌 사에
평생을 바쳐 일하셨고

734
00:44:26.781 --> 00:44:29.795
거기서 가장 뛰어난
컴퓨터 엔지니어였죠

735
00:44:29.796 --> 00:44:32.170
어느날 갑자기
아버지가 해고당했어요

736
00:44:32.171 --> 00:44:34.287
아무도 이유를 몰랐죠

737
00:44:34.288 --> 00:44:37.274
어느날 말씀해 주시더군요

738
00:44:37.275 --> 00:44:39.843
백혈병이 있다고요

739
00:44:39.844 --> 00:44:42.111
아무한테도 말하지
말라고 하셨어요

740
00:44:42.112 --> 00:44:44.779
특히 저희 엄마한테요

741
00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:46.449
그래서 전 입을 닫고 있었죠

742
00:44:46.501 --> 00:44:48.617
몇 달이 지났고

743
00:44:48.618 --> 00:44:51.204
아버지 병세가 악화됐어요

744
00:44:51.205 --> 00:44:55.291
계속 걱정하다가

745
00:44:55.292 --> 00:44:57.460
결국 엄마한테 털어놨어요

746
00:44:57.512 --> 00:45:00.270
아버지는 엄청 화를 내셨죠

747
00:45:00.271 --> 00:45:02.715
고래 고래 소리지르셨어요

748
00:45:02.767 --> 00:45:06.733
아빠를 껴안고
죄송하다 하려 했지만

749
00:45:06.734 --> 00:45:09.440
아빠는 계속 저를 밀어냈어요

750
00:45:09.441 --> 00:45:11.693
너무나 세게 밀친 나머지
저는 창밖으로 떨어졌죠

751
00:45:11.694 --> 00:45:14.894
떨어지면서 팔이 부러졌어요

752
00:45:14.946 --> 00:45:17.531
아버지는 이후에
저랑 한마디도 안하셨죠

753
00:45:17.532 --> 00:45:19.615
저를 쳐다보지도 않았어요

754
00:45:19.616 --> 00:45:22.285
아빠가 돌아가신 날조차도요

755
00:45:25.379 --> 00:45:27.192
이제 됐죠?

756
00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:44.891
부모를 잃는 기분이
어떤 기분인지 아네

757
00:45:44.943 --> 00:45:47.143
가슴이 찢어지지

758
00:45:50.148 --> 00:45:54.318
자넨 아버지가
옳았다고 생각하나?

759
00:45:54.319 --> 00:45:56.153
뭐가요?

760
00:45:56.154 --> 00:45:58.592
자넬 상처준거 말이야

761
00:45:58.593 --> 00:46:00.657
네가 엄마한테
말했다는 이유만으로

762
00:46:00.658 --> 00:46:02.364
그 처벌이 가혹하다고
생각하진 않았나?

763
00:46:02.365 --> 00:46:04.244
저는 아무것도
하지 않았어요

764
00:46:04.245 --> 00:46:06.079
그저 아빠를
돕고 싶었을 뿐이에요

765
00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:07.683
그의 신뢰를
배반하면서 말이지

766
00:46:07.684 --> 00:46:09.882
저는 8살이었...

767
00:46:15.139 --> 00:46:18.642
자넨 신성한 약속을 져버린거야

768
00:46:27.455 --> 00:46:31.738
자막 제작: 기미갤 12:51
Don't take anything for granted.

769
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.430
What I'm about to tell you is top secret,

770
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.090
Evil Corp.

771
00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:07.130
Tyrell Wellick.

772
00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:08.610
You want to do these together then?

773
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:09.780
Pure Molly...

774
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:10.750
No, Shayla.

775
00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:12.360
I need you to come to AllSafe.

776
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.620
Shit. They're in the network?

777
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.600
This is it. Fsociety.

778
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.380
They're telling me to leave it here.

779
00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:20.200
Who are you?

780
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.410
I think you should come with me.

781
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.020
Yeah, that's Darlene.

782
00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.060
You are going to modify the dat file

783
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.540
put Colby's IP in there.

784
00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:27.400
You do that,

785
00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.120
you have set in motion the largest revolution the
world will ever see.

786
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.610
sources have confirmed the hacks were

787
00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:37.870
in part tied to Colby's terminal.

788
00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.670
Sir, step inside the car.

789
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:47.570
Bon soir, Elliot.

790
00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.950
"Give a man a gun and he can rob a bank,

791
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.630
but give a man a bank, and he can rob the world."

792
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.950
It's a bit of a silly expression, actually.

793
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.000
A little reductive, but still...

794
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:24.440
I like it,

795
00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.480
for the same reason most people hate it,

796
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.840
because to me it means that

797
00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.370
power belongs to the people that take it.

798
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.550
Nothing to do with their hard work, strong
ambitions,

799
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.790
or rightful qualifications, no.

800
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.500
The actual will to take is often the only thing
that's necessary.

801
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.030
I'm sorry to bring you in like this.

802
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.130
Technically what we're doing might be considered
illegal,

803
00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:50.820
which is why I'm surrounded

804
00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.960
by eleven of our most annoying lawyers.

805
00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.120
Elliot Alderson...

806
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.570
I want to offer you

807
00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.340
a position here at Evil Corp.

808
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.730
I want you to head our cybersecurity division.

809
00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.030
Except I can't officially offer you anything

810
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.430
since we have this non-compete with your employer,
Allsafe.

811
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.790
But if you do this of your own accord--

812
00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.450
when you do this--

813
00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.380
you'll be a multi-millionaire within the next five
years.

814
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.560
What do you say?

815
00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:39.470
Can I--

816
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.190
Can I think about it?

817
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.510
Gentlemen, I need the room.

818
00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.040
Yes, thank you. Yes, yes.

819
00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:13.790
You know,

820
00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:18.790
Evil Corp has just named me interim CTO.

821
00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.620
It won't be long until it's official.

822
00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.030
I will be the youngest executive this company has
ever seen.

823
00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.400
I should track down these hackers out there

824
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.820
just to thank them.

825
00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.430
In a way, it's kind of, um...

826
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.240
What's the word in English?

827
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.440
Serendipitous? Right?

828
00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.930
You know, by the end of the quarter,

829
00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.400
we're going to revamp our entire network

830
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.890
and consolidate our security protocols.

831
00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.050
We're going to handle everything internally,

832
00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.150
which means all of our vendors, including Allsafe,

833
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.640
will be cut loose.

834
00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.280
And it's no secret that once Allsafe loses us as a
client,

835
00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:16.480
they'll be fini.

836
00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.750
And when that happens,

837
00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.090
I want you to be where you belong:

838
00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:22.840
here with me.

839
00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.580
This is an important choice you're making, Elliot.

840
00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.490
I just wanted you to know all the facts

841
00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.620
before you made your final decision.

842
00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:46.390
I think I'm happy where I am.

843
00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:13.690
Well, I thought I'd ask.

844
00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.530
Call this number if you need to get in touch with
Mr. Wellick.

845
00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:01.180
You can call me Mr. X.

846
00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.190
Come on, you've never seen JFK?

847
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:09.530
Oliver Stone movie?

848
00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.040
Sir, I gotta be honest. That's embarrassing.

849
00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.480
Do yourself a favor and watch it.

850
00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:16.950
And pay, for Christ's sake.

851
00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.080
Anyway, you can call me Mr. Sutherland for now.

852
00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:22.290
Don't hesitate to reach me when you're ready.

853
00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:24.870
We're always close by.

854
00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:37.980
I'm gonna set a date right now--

855
00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:39.010
- No, we're not. - For later.

856
00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:40.390
I gotta go, thank you very much.

857
00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:41.840
- You gonna have me up? - No.

858
00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:44.440
- Gonna have me up? - No, stop.

859
00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:46.930
- I'm coming up. - No, you're not coming up.

860
00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:48.490
Another time. Okay, I gotta go.

861
00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:49.470
Come on.

862
00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:57.370
- Everything all right? - Yeah, he's just a
creeper.

863
00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:59.880
I hate it when your employers can't take a hint.

864
00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:07.370
Hey, is your radiator messed up?

865
00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:10.000
Because it's like 3,000 degrees in my apartment.

866
00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:15.240
Hey, are you okay? You seem off.

867
00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:19.670
While we're here, you mind if I reup?

868
00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:21.990
A little early to reup, don't you think?

869
00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:24.710
I'm deviating from the schedule a little.

870
00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:27.760
Whoa, never thought I'd see the day, Mr. Stricty
Pants,

871
00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.730
but okie dokie.

872
00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.390
Oh, yeah. Shit, I'm out of the other ones.

873
00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:35.720
No, just the morphine. It's good.

874
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:38.630
Uh, no, you made me promise never to give you
these

875
00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.030
unless I had your Subs.

876
00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:43.660
- Shayla. - No, Elliot.

877
00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:45.490
Promises matter, okay?

878
00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:47.620
I take this shit to heart.

879
00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:53.820
Oh, my God.

880
00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:56.890
Fine, but you have to promise me you won't do a
lot

881
00:07:56.890 --> 00:07:58.600
until I get your withdrawal meds, okay?

882
00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:00.610
I'll go see Fernando later or something.

883
00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:03.570
No, you have to say it.

884
00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:08.400
I promise.

885
00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:20.040
Hey, man.

886
00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:23.110
What, you think I forgot about you?

887
00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:25.210
Trust me, I need you now more than ever.

888
00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:30.830
We gotta get to work.

889
00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:33.460
Hacking Tyrell Wellick, you'd think it'd be
tricky,

890
00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:35.960
but it wasn't--Evil Corp's corporate mail servers,

891
00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:38.220
they haven't patched anything since Shellshock.

892
00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:40.040
He doesn't even use two-step verification.

893
00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:41.830
His password was just his wife's maiden name

894
00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:44.520
and Sweden's independence date, 6-6.

895
00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:46.930
One six away from the obvious, but still,

896
00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:48.890
this is bad noob practice.

897
00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:53.900
These emails...

898
00:08:57.710 --> 00:09:00.960
His life... it's nice, happy, perfect.

899
00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:02.540
This doesn't make sense.

900
00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:05.070
Did he know I was going to hack him?

901
00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:09.220
Did he let me?

902
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:14.480
I'm gonna need to wipe everything.

903
00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:12.370
I know, I know, taking more than I should.

904
00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:16.060
I'm breaking my rule, but come on, it's an off
week.

905
00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:55.340
Come on.

906
00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:02.610
My man, you gotta--

907
00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:04.600
You gotta deuce it out over here, all right?

908
00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:10.390
Yo, you gotta do your business up in here, all
right?

909
00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:17.840
You got this. You got this.

910
00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:48.000
Terry Colby, the chief technology officer of--

911
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.480
Terry Colby's arrest is on everyone's mind.

912
00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:53.540
Screen. Might as well be the same thing nowadays.

913
00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:57.650
How do I go back to work after this?

914
00:11:57.650 --> 00:11:59.520
How can I focus on anything?

915
00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:02.070
And when's Mr. Robot going to contact me again?

916
00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:03.420
What's he waiting for?

917
00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:06.960
Did I just destroy a man's life for no reason?

918
00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:09.890
I'm gonna talk to HR about a salary bump for you.

919
00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:11.480
- Oh, please. - No, no.

920
00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:12.520
Take the raise.

921
00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:16.240
It's not gonna be much, but it's the best I can do
right now.

922
00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:18.510
Elliot...

923
00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:20.460
You saved the company.

924
00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:25.150
Now...

925
00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:30.350
Why didn't you tell me about the dat file?

926
00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:33.900
You could've come in here at any time before the
meeting

927
00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:35.770
to say you found something, but you didn't.

928
00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:39.950
I gotta be honest. I found that kind of curious.

929
00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:44.700
Yeah, I didn't know what I had.

930
00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:48.440
Could've easily been a junk file.

931
00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:49.430
C'mon...

932
00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:50.870
You're never sure about anything

933
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:53.170
unless there's something to be sure about.

934
00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:56.060
Maybe you don't know me that well.

935
00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:01.160
Regardless,

936
00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:05.700
I still need you to stay on it, now more than
ever.

937
00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:09.100
I mean, who knows what these fsociety hackers are
going to do next.

938
00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:09.980
What did he just say?

939
00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:12.710
- What did you just say? - The ones working with
Colby.

940
00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:16.220
Who knows how deep these data dumps are going to
get,

941
00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:17.430
and Evil Corp is--

942
00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:18.840
What're you talking about?

943
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.140
There's a twist.

944
00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:24.010
You're usually the one a step ahead of me.

945
00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:26.170
They hit the mother lode during the breach.

946
00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:29.480
Potentially terabytes worth of emails and files.

947
00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:31.320
They're threatening to dump everything

948
00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:33.550
unless the FBI frees Colby.

949
00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:35.480
They released the video this morning.

950
00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:47.060
Hello, Evil Corp. We are fsociety.

951
00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:49.190
Over the years, we have been watching you.

952
00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:51.160
Your financial abuse of the poor;

953
00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:53.100
your corruption of governments;

954
00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:56.080
your cover-ups of the murder of innocent, ordinary
citizens,

955
00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:58.100
all for the sake of a profit.

956
00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:01.960
This is why we at fsociety have decided you must
die.

957
00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:05.950
We are malicious and hostile. We do not
compromise.

958
00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:07.610
We are relentless.

959
00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:09.620
We will not stop until every tentacle

960
00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:13.630
of your evil monstrosity is sliced off at the
nerve.

961
00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:16.010
But we are also not without mercy.

962
00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:18.670
Our latest hack was our last warning.

963
00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:22.410
Meet our demands, and we will consider not
destroying you.

964
00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:24.920
First, release our leader Terry Colby

965
00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:27.230
from your illegitimate prison immediately.

966
00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:30.460
Second, release all the people of the world

967
00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:33.820
from your even more illegitimate prisons of debt.

968
00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:36.440
Third, dissolve your corporation

969
00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:40.320
and donate all your assets to charities around the
world.

970
00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:42.630
This proposal is non-negotiable.

971
00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:45.300
The people are realizing they don't have freedom
of choice

972
00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:46.830
so long as you exist.

973
00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:48.640
The people are waking up,

974
00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:51.550
no longer accepting your economic slavery.

975
00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:55.460
Meet these demands, or we will kill you.

976
00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:57.360
Consider yourself warned.

977
00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:03.400
Play it again.

978
00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:06.710
Yo, yo, yo, yo, my album just dropped.

979
00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:10.470
Yo, please buy my CD. Only cost you 20 likes.

980
00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:13.100
Yo, it'll give you the feels, y'all, I swear.

981
00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.220
The CD's free. All's I ask is you Tweet.

982
00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:16.480
Help my social media outreach.

983
00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:17.910
You know, be like, "I want to set up this meeting.

984
00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:19.450
It's like a very, like a--"

985
00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:20.710
Oh, Elliot!

986
00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:22.110
Hey, congrats, man.

987
00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:24.790
Allsafe is all over the internet today because of
you.

988
00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:27.430
Dude, we should celebrate. We have this Groupon

989
00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:29.570
for four at Morton's on Thursday.

990
00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:31.760
This other couple we were going with totally
bailed.

991
00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:32.850
Why don't you come with?

992
00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:34.910
Their steaks are badass. It's $29.95--

993
00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:36.390
I'm not sure that Elliot would like that.

994
00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:37.530
Yeah, okay.

995
00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:40.030
Yeah? Okay. Awesome, man.

996
00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:42.590
And, hey, why don't we make it a double date?

997
00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:44.070
I heard that you had a girlfriend.

998
00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:46.410
Ollie, you weren't supposed to say anything.

999
00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:47.870
Babe, it's cool. Elliot's okay with it.

1000
00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:50.160
Yeah, okay, sure. I--have to go.

1001
00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:53.660
Um, my neighbor's complaining about the dog
barking again.

1002
00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:01.690
Since when does he have a dog?

1003
00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:03.790
You look like a beautiful couple.

1004
00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:05.200
Yo, my album just dropped,

1005
00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:06.730
You like rap, hip-hop?

1006
00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:08.600
Yo, this shit is deep, lyrical, poetic.

1007
00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:10.390
Yo, your girl will like this, my man, I swear.

1008
00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:12.510
Come on, bro, you've been outside our building for
two weeks now.

1009
00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:14.230
All right, you know, I'll take it,

1010
00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:15.560
if you leave us alone.

1011
00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:17.390
Thank you, thank you, man, thank you.

1012
00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:19.720
And I'll tweet, but only if I like it, all right?

1013
00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:21.540
I only have 48 followers, but it's growing.

1014
00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:22.900
- No doubt, no doubt. - Some tastemakers in there
so--

1015
00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:24.330
I feel you, I feel you.

1016
00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:25.130
- Yeah. - All right.

1017
00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:26.860
Yo, I appreciate it, man, really.

1018
00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:27.940
- You guys have a good day. - Yeah, you too.

1019
00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:29.630
Thank you so much. Check track two out.

1020
00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:31.500
- Track two. - All right, man.

1021
00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:34.010
This was never part of the plan.

1022
00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:36.210
Data dumps? Releasing Terry Colby?

1023
00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:37.830
None of this makes sense.

1024
00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:40.520
Need to cut off all ties with fsociety.

1025
00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:42.190
Need to disconnect.

1026
00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:44.210
We need to call in sick and lie low for a--

1027
00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:02.820
Dude! Jesus Christ! I am naked, asshole!

1028
00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:04.680
Don't stare at me!

1029
00:17:04.850 --> 00:17:06.480
Why the hell are you in my shower?

1030
00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:08.470
Well, I was waiting for you.

1031
00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:09.720
You were supposed to come last night.

1032
00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:12.300
- Did you forget? - Come? Where?

1033
00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:14.500
It's fine, everyone's coming later.

1034
00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:22.730
I'm stealing your clothes.

1035
00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:25.450
My dress has cum stains on it.

1036
00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:31.290
Jesus, I am just messing with you.

1037
00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:32.560
My stuff is just in the wash.

1038
00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:34.400
I'm gonna borrow this for the time being.

1039
00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:37.290
Oh, by the way,

1040
00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:39.430
your dog shat on your bed.

1041
00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:41.830
You gotta walk that thing.

1042
00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:45.770
Hey, please take Flipper for a while.

1043
00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:48.400
She probably needs a walk or something.

1044
00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:50.120
She keeps shitting everywhere.

1045
00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:51.290
Of course she needs a walk, Elliot.

1046
00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:52.530
She's a friggin' dog.

1047
00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:55.520
Yo, I want to stop and get some froyo before we
go.

1048
00:17:57.850 --> 00:18:00.080
Uh, I'll be back later.

1049
00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:02.740
- I owe you. - Yeah, big time.

1050
00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:17.090
How do you know where I live?

1051
00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:19.140
Why wouldn't I know where you live?

1052
00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:22.210
I don't know. I don't know where you live.

1053
00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:30.250
I don't live anywhere at the present.

1054
00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:34.490
The douche I was dating proposed to me, can you
believe?

1055
00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:36.720
I mean, what an asshole.

1056
00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:40.750
Anyways, we got into this huge fight, and--

1057
00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:41.900
What the hell am I doing?

1058
00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:44.530
This chick is out of her mind batshit crazy.

1059
00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:46.540
I gotta go back, tell Gideon everything.

1060
00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:47.860
He'll understand, right?

1061
00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:49.250
He'll know what to do.

1062
00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:51.710
It's whatevs. He'll take me back.

1063
00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:52.990
He's just gotta get over this whole

1064
00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:55.340
"Love is forever" bullshit.

1065
00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:57.730
I'll do my disappearing act for a minute,

1066
00:18:57.730 --> 00:18:59.720
and then he'll come to his senses.

1067
00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:02.940
- Stand clear of the closing door. - You know,
it's our thing.

1068
00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:05.260
Quick!

1069
00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:16.330
Can she see them, too?

1070
00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:17.450
What?

1071
00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:19.400
I like to stay on my toes.

1072
00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:25.550
Speaking of, that's, like, one of the most
annoying things--

1073
00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:28.110
But what if Tyrell finds out? What will he do?

1074
00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:31.580
Shit, there's basically no scenario in which

1075
00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:33.610
I'm not getting killed or going to jail.

1076
00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:38.020
Because I wanted a turtle, and he was like, "No--"

1077
00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:40.210
I might need to crash with you for a couple of
nights.

1078
00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:41.730
That's cool, right?

1079
00:19:42.730 --> 00:19:43.880
Seriously?

1080
00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:46.560
Fine! I'll crash at Mobley's.

1081
00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:48.710
Don't love dogs anyway.

1082
00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:50.710
Especially ones that shit in your bed.

1083
00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:52.600
I mean, how do you live like that, honestly?

1084
00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:54.660
How do you go to sleep when you know that
there's...

1085
00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:55.270
For all we know,

1086
00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:57.580
I could be walking into a trap right now.

1087
00:19:57.580 --> 00:19:59.920
We could be dead the second I walk through that
door.

1088
00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:03.610
Come on, kid. We got big things in store.

1089
00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:04.980
Big things.

1090
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.620
Man of the hour. Take a curtsy.

1091
00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:22.920
Goddamn ducks.

1092
00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:26.850
Hey, hey, man!

1093
00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:29.040
What's... Oh. Shit, sorry, sorry, dude.

1094
00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:30.300
Um, okay.

1095
00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:33.090
Anyway, just, awesome work, man.

1096
00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:34.010
Really awesome.

1097
00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:35.380
Right on, man. Right on.

1098
00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:36.710
- Real cool. - Great.

1099
00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:39.400
So now that we're all done going down on each
other,

1100
00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:41.660
can we please hear the plan?

1101
00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:43.340
Where are we at with Steel Mountain?

1102
00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:44.660
If I'm not mistaken,

1103
00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:46.350
these lines aren't 100% safe yet,

1104
00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:48.310
and we still haven't made the Colby project
disappear.

1105
00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:49.230
Seriously?

1106
00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:51.420
It's been weeks. Any links or traces

1107
00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:52.720
would have been owned by now.

1108
00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:55.210
The lines are clean, Boss, I swear.

1109
00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:57.640
- Thank you. - I mean, um...

1110
00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:59.790
if it makes you feel better, Romero and I can
check...

1111
00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:02.010
Great! Make me feel great.

1112
00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:04.840
I'm gonna hang back over here, collect my
thoughts.

1113
00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:16.090
What's her deal?

1114
00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:18.080
Ah, she's a complicated woman.

1115
00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:19.980
Most malware coders are. Am I right?

1116
00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:22.030
She showed up at my apartment.

1117
00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:24.230
Why does she know where I live?

1118
00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:25.250
Let's not focus on her.

1119
00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:27.930
That'll be like entering a bad K-hole you'll never
wake up from.

1120
00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:30.590
Instead, I need you to focus on the next phase of
our project.

1121
00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:33.120
Comet, the natural gas plant up around Albany?

1122
00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:37.900
We're gonna blow it up.

1123
00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:40.580
Why would you blow...

1124
00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:44.160
Comet plant's right next to Steel Mountain.

1125
00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:45.780
Which, as you know,

1126
00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:48.590
is the off-site and data storage facility

1127
00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:50.400
for every corporation in the S

1128
00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:51.460
including everyone's favorite--

1129
00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:53.350
- Evil Corp. - Bingo!

1130
00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:56.520
You're gonna destroy their tape backups.

1131
00:21:57.610 --> 00:21:59.130
They're gonna be looking out for something like
that.

1132
00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:01.760
They've been on high alert ever since the hack.

1133
00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:03.210
From what I heard, they've caught their hacker.

1134
00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:05.530
- Haven't they? - No, they haven't.

1135
00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:08.210
- Tyrell Wellick knows. - What they want him to
know!

1136
00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:10.350
He's a corporate robot just like the rest of them.

1137
00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:12.530
Besides, the entire company is gonna be reeling

1138
00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:14.400
from all the data dumps we've got in store for
them--

1139
00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:16.180
and man, do we have some goodies.

1140
00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:17.890
Some good old-fashioned executive racism,

1141
00:22:17.890 --> 00:22:19.770
sexism, Fascism.

1142
00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:22.200
Trust me, we are gonna "ism" so much all over them

1143
00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:23.690
they won't be able to see straight.

1144
00:22:23.690 --> 00:22:25.910
And asking for Colby's release as ransom was
genius.

1145
00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:27.550
That'll only make his spotlight bigger,

1146
00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:29.000
keeping it off us.

1147
00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:31.340
That neat little ditty was Trenton's idea.

1148
00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:34.200
She may look innocent, but I'd be careful.

1149
00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:36.450
She's got some Allah Akbar in her.

1150
00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:38.740
And while all that's going on,

1151
00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:41.200
you will use your Allsafe security clearance

1152
00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:43.650
to hack the Comet PLC, increase the pressure,

1153
00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:45.430
causing a gas pipeline explosion

1154
00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:49.180
making Steel Mountain go kablooey along with Evil
Corp's soul.

1155
00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:55.960
They know about all this?

1156
00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:58.020
You're the first.

1157
00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:02.650
Workers?

1158
00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:05.160
Anyone living around the plant...

1159
00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:06.730
They all die?

1160
00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:08.360
We'll give them a head start.

1161
00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:10.120
Sound some alarms. They'll be fine.

1162
00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:15.430
You're blowing up a gas pipeline.

1163
00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:17.750
The world is a dangerous place, Elliot,

1164
00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:19.260
not because of those who do evil,

1165
00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:21.890
but because of those who look on and do nothing.

1166
00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:22.950
This is war.

1167
00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:24.940
People will die. C'est la mort.

1168
00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:28.410
And once we blow up the pipeline,

1169
00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:30.860
Darlene's worm will kick into high gear

1170
00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:31.900
at the U.S. Data center

1171
00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:34.530
which you helped to us install, thank you very
much.

1172
00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:38.720
The redundant backups at their eastern data center
in China--

1173
00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:41.640
the Dark Army is covering us on that.

1174
00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:44.590
Dark Army? Why, man?

1175
00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:46.570
They got no code. They hack for anyone:

1176
00:23:46.570 --> 00:23:48.370
terrorists, North Korea, Iran, Russia--

1177
00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:51.600
Which means they hate U.S. capitalism just as much
as anyone.

1178
00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:55.660
Last but not least.

1179
00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:58.130
Steel Mountain.

1180
00:23:58.450 --> 00:24:00.280
The hacker's dilemma.

1181
00:24:00.370 --> 00:24:03.370
What to do when a bunch of data you want to
destroy

1182
00:24:03.370 --> 00:24:05.170
is completely off the grid?

1183
00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:12.820
I'm not killing anyone.

1184
00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:17.320
Tell me one thing, Elliot.

1185
00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:20.080
Are you a one or a zero?

1186
00:24:21.610 --> 00:24:23.310
That's the question you have to ask yourself.

1187
00:24:23.310 --> 00:24:25.140
Are you a yes or a no?

1188
00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:27.580
Are you going to act or not?

1189
00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:34.250
Yo...you've been staring at a computer screen

1190
00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:36.180
way too long, homie.

1191
00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:38.140
Life's not that binary.

1192
00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:39.370
Isn't it?

1193
00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:41.980
Sure, there are grays--

1194
00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:44.410
but when you come right down to it, at its core,

1195
00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:48.190
beneath every choice, there's either a one or a
zero.

1196
00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:50.950
You either do something or you don't.

1197
00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:54.100
You walk out that door, you've decided to do
nothing,

1198
00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:57.450
to say no, which means you do not come back.

1199
00:24:58.050 --> 00:25:00.980
You leave, you are no longer a part of this.

1200
00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:02.550
You become a zero.

1201
00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:05.740
If you stay,

1202
00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:07.440
if you want to change the world,

1203
00:25:09.570 --> 00:25:10.810
you become a yes.

1204
00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:13.050
You become a one.

1205
00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:15.580
So, I'll ask you again:

1206
00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:19.180
are you a one or a zero?

1207
00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:21.410
An innocent man is in prison because of what I
did.

1208
00:25:21.410 --> 00:25:23.250
Come on, let's not kid ourselves!

1209
00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:25.170
This has nothing to do with Colby.

1210
00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:31.730
This isn't even about my revolution.

1211
00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:34.310
This is more than that for you.

1212
00:25:34.570 --> 00:25:37.310
This is about how those bastards slowly killed
your father

1213
00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:39.020
and how you wished he'd done something about it.

1214
00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:41.910
But he didn't. Because he was a zero,

1215
00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:44.030
just like you're being right now.

1216
00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:47.560
F--- you.

1217
00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:53.080
Disappearing again?

1218
00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:59.760
I'm not killing anyone. Leave me out of this.

1219
00:26:01.450 --> 00:26:03.750
You don't get to disappear from this.

1220
00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:05.260
We can do it with or without you,

1221
00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:07.150
but you're a part of it either way!

1222
00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:10.870
Yeah, even your stupid hoodie can't protect you,
bitch!

1223
00:26:10.890 --> 00:26:12.090
This was a mistake.

1224
00:26:12.090 --> 00:26:14.050
I've gotta turn them in. Should I turn them in?

1225
00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:16.380
Will I get into trouble? Shit, she's right.

1226
00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:19.010
I'm culpable now. No, we're culpable.

1227
00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:22.550
You're in this with me, so start thinking of
solutions now.

1228
00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:28.460
Shayla?

1229
00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:35.730
Yo, Shayla.

1230
00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:37.190
Yo, bro.

1231
00:26:38.530 --> 00:26:39.890
Can I help you with something?

1232
00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:46.500
I, uh...just need to talk to Shayla.

1233
00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:48.050
Oh, your girl.

1234
00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:49.940
She in the tub.

1235
00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:56.450
Shayla.

1236
00:26:56.450 --> 00:26:58.460
Yo, she'll be out in a minute.

1237
00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:02.320
Can sit and wait if you want.

1238
00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:06.930
I think we should check on her, make sure she's
all right.

1239
00:27:09.330 --> 00:27:11.950
You a funny dude. I like you.

1240
00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:14.460
Don't be rude.

1241
00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:17.250
Sit down and chill.

1242
00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:37.360
No, that's right.

1243
00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:42.890
You only do this.

1244
00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:46.780
Only nigga I know that take withdrawal meds while
he using.

1245
00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:48.660
That's smart.

1246
00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:52.270
Probably even convinced yourself you ain't an
addict.

1247
00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:55.020
Oh, shit.

1248
00:27:55.450 --> 00:27:57.690
Forgot to introduce myself. I'm Fernan--

1249
00:27:57.690 --> 00:27:59.430
Fernando Vera, Shayla's supplier.

1250
00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:01.350
One of the worst human beings I've ever hacked.

1251
00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:05.250
His password? "Eatadick6969."

1252
00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:08.840
Aside from the massive amounts of money he spends
on porn and webcams,

1253
00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:12.650
he does all his drug transactions through emails,
IMs, Twitter.

1254
00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:15.520
The fact that the cops haven't caught him yet is
beyond me.

1255
00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:16.780
If they had half a brain cell,

1256
00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:19.510
they'd be able to crack his gang's simplistic
code,

1257
00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:21.250
if it can even be called that.

1258
00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:23.940
After only a couple of hours of timing his tweets

1259
00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:25.380
with related news articles,

1260
00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:27.240
I figured out that "biscuit" and "clickety"

1261
00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:29.150
clearly referenced guns.

1262
00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:31.940
"Food," "sea shells" or "gas" for bullets.

1263
00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:34.890
And the ultimate: "Rock to sleep early."

1264
00:28:34.890 --> 00:28:37.240
I haven't made the direct connection to a hit yet,

1265
00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:38.970
but the math of guns plus bullets

1266
00:28:38.970 --> 00:28:40.930
usually adds up to one thing.

1267
00:28:41.010 --> 00:28:42.770
I've thought about turning him in,

1268
00:28:42.770 --> 00:28:44.740
but he's Shayla's only supplier.

1269
00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:47.040
I take him down, I lose my drugs,

1270
00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:50.300
and with everything going on right now, I can't
have that.

1271
00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:51.850
You get that, though?

1272
00:28:53.770 --> 00:28:54.950
Anyway, bro,

1273
00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:57.120
I ain't nothing to worry about.

1274
00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:00.100
Just making a drop for you.

1275
00:29:02.030 --> 00:29:03.310
What's your name, anyway?

1276
00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:06.720
Elliot.

1277
00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:08.460
What it mean?

1278
00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:12.190
What, you ain't never Googled it?

1279
00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:13.030
Man, you gotta do that.

1280
00:29:13.030 --> 00:29:15.540
The meaning of a person's name is important, bro.

1281
00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:18.260
Yo, she good! She good.

1282
00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:24.000
Trust me.

1283
00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:26.530
Took care of that shit myself.

1284
00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:34.300
You remind me of me when I was younger,

1285
00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:36.110
depressed and sullen.

1286
00:29:36.690 --> 00:29:39.230
Matter of fact, tried to kill myself, a couple of
times.

1287
00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:42.410
Never could get that shit right.

1288
00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:45.160
Biology wasn't my strong suit.

1289
00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:49.150
I hated myself, man. Still do.

1290
00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:52.230
Thought that shit was a weakness for a long time.

1291
00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:01.050
Then I realized that shit was my power.

1292
00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:05.410
People walk around, act like they know what hate
means.

1293
00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:09.970
Nah, no one does, until you hate yourself.

1294
00:30:09.970 --> 00:30:11.120
I mean...

1295
00:30:12.430 --> 00:30:14.080
truly hate yourself.

1296
00:30:15.910 --> 00:30:17.230
That's power.

1297
00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:31.090
You ain't scared of me, are you?

1298
00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:36.170
That's good.

1299
00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:39.590
Means I didn't waste my time making friends with
you.

1300
00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:43.840
You don't really need these, do you?

1301
00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:47.090
Man of your courage can last through a little
withdrawal.

1302
00:30:49.090 --> 00:30:52.660
Ya know, you the only reason why I met Shayla.

1303
00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:56.420
I'm the only nigga in town carrying everything,

1304
00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:58.990
including your precious Suboxone.

1305
00:30:58.990 --> 00:31:02.770
So, in a weird way, I should be thanking you.

1306
00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:04.360
You brought her to me.

1307
00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:07.480
Your star orbiting with mine, gravitationally,

1308
00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:10.810
brought me the love of my life, Elliot.

1309
00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:13.070
I mean, this, us?

1310
00:31:13.070 --> 00:31:14.240
Being here?

1311
00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:15.900
This has...

1312
00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:18.640
beautiful meaning.

1313
00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:22.120
But make no mistake, that girl in there...

1314
00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:24.540
is mine.

1315
00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:27.510
I don't know what I'd do without her.

1316
00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:30.860
Now, I don't know what kind of arrangement

1317
00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:34.750
you had with her before, but now that we
friends...

1318
00:31:36.570 --> 00:31:38.500
I trust you respect this boundary.

1319
00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:40.610
Feel me?

1320
00:31:51.130 --> 00:31:53.860
A dude earlier today gave me that same look.

1321
00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:56.070
Only thing I gotta say is,

1322
00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:58.540
there's a smart time to be scared, bro...

1323
00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:02.260
and a stupid time.

1324
00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:10.090
Shayla?

1325
00:32:10.090 --> 00:32:10.820
The lock pick.

1326
00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:12.620
Every hacker's favorite sport.

1327
00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:14.020
The perfect system to crack,

1328
00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:16.090
mostly because unlike virtual systems,

1329
00:32:16.090 --> 00:32:17.940
when you break it, you can feel it.

1330
00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:19.840
You can see it. You can hear it.

1331
00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:27.290
Shayla.

1332
00:32:33.290 --> 00:32:34.050
Wake up.

1333
00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:39.880
What happened?

1334
00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:42.260
You okay?

1335
00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:45.970
Why was that asshole here?

1336
00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:48.000
Why am I in the tub?

1337
00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:56.120
I don't know, um...I told him I needed your pills.

1338
00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:58.160
He came over. We smoked a little.

1339
00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:02.250
You remember having sex with him?

1340
00:33:02.490 --> 00:33:05.080
What? No.

1341
00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:07.300
But he definitely does.

1342
00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:08.340
Okay, let's go.

1343
00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:10.540
- Get your purse, make sure-- - Stop.

1344
00:33:10.790 --> 00:33:12.790
I'm not going anywhere, okay?

1345
00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:15.420
What do you mean?

1346
00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:17.330
Oh, he's just gonna get away with it?

1347
00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:21.840
You can't go back to him. Hey, I don't need the
pills.

1348
00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:23.720
- Just find someone else. - I can't.

1349
00:33:28.650 --> 00:33:31.150
He gives me a really good deal on the split.

1350
00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:34.360
I make good money.

1351
00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:35.550
There it is again,

1352
00:33:35.550 --> 00:33:38.060
the invisible hand at work, controlling us,

1353
00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:40.850
even if it pushes us past our threshold of pain.

1354
00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:42.490
It's not gonna stop.

1355
00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:45.650
What if he does it again?

1356
00:33:46.390 --> 00:33:48.090
Promise me you won't do anything?

1357
00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:51.480
I'm serious, Elliot.

1358
00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:53.580
There's nothing to be done here.

1359
00:33:55.330 --> 00:33:56.870
It's not like I have a choice.

1360
00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:02.500
Would you mind sleeping here tonight?

1361
00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:08.990
Choices.

1362
00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:11.650
Maybe Mr. Robot's right.

1363
00:34:11.970 --> 00:34:15.790
That's what this is all about, the yesses and nos
of life.

1364
00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:19.110
But do we decide them or do they decide us?

1365
00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:21.950
Fernando Vera. I get rid of him,

1366
00:34:21.950 --> 00:34:24.230
I get rid of my drug dealer's supplier.

1367
00:34:24.290 --> 00:34:25.810
I get rid of the morphine.

1368
00:34:25.970 --> 00:34:28.400
And the pain I've been holding in comes rushing
out.

1369
00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:31.200
Sure, I can try to find another dealer,

1370
00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:34.230
but like Vera said, no one on the streets deals
Suboxone.

1371
00:34:34.370 --> 00:34:36.820
I could go back to digitally counterfeiting
scripts,

1372
00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:39.620
but pharmas spend a lot of dough protecting their
wares.

1373
00:34:39.850 --> 00:34:41.990
Most places only take paper scripts.

1374
00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:44.800
Continuously getting legit refills isn't
realistic,

1375
00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:46.490
and neither is being a junkie.

1376
00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:49.830
So I quit cold turkey or let Vera exist.

1377
00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:53.750
I know what you're thinking. The answer's too
obvious.

1378
00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:56.100
Vera may have been groping Shayla before,

1379
00:34:56.250 --> 00:34:57.640
but he's graduated to rape.

1380
00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:04.530
Just like Shayla, he's left me no choice.

1381
00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:07.470
He can't be allowed to exist anymore.

1382
00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:22.450
Perhaps we should start with how you're feeling.

1383
00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:28.880
Not good.

1384
00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:32.100
What's not good right now?

1385
00:35:34.610 --> 00:35:35.560
Everything.

1386
00:35:37.790 --> 00:35:39.880
Humor me with some specifics.

1387
00:35:45.370 --> 00:35:48.380
How do we know if we're in control?

1388
00:35:50.850 --> 00:35:54.060
That we're not just making the best

1389
00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:56.300
of what comes at us, and that's it.

1390
00:35:57.030 --> 00:36:00.520
Trying to constantly pick between two options.

1391
00:36:01.290 --> 00:36:03.340
Like your two paintings in the waiting room.

1392
00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:08.520
Or...Coke and Pepsi.

1393
00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:11.830
McDonald's or Burger King?

1394
00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:15.680
Hyundai or Honda?

1395
00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:23.640
It's all part of the same blur, right?

1396
00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:26.970
Just out of focus enough.

1397
00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:30.100
It's the illusion of choice.

1398
00:36:30.930 --> 00:36:33.980
Half of us can't even pick our own--

1399
00:36:34.070 --> 00:36:36.910
our cable, gas, electric.

1400
00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:41.240
The water we drink, our health insurance.

1401
00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:43.630
Even if we did, would it matter?

1402
00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:48.400
You know, if our only option is Blue Cross or Blue
Shield,

1403
00:36:48.490 --> 00:36:50.820
what the f--- is the difference?

1404
00:36:56.290 --> 00:36:58.270
In fact, aren't they-- aren't they the same?

1405
00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:02.080
No, man...

1406
00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:06.220
our choices are prepaid for us,

1407
00:37:06.910 --> 00:37:08.160
long time ago.

1408
00:37:10.350 --> 00:37:12.860
I'm sorry you feel you have no control.

1409
00:37:15.350 --> 00:37:17.990
Thought I was doing something good.

1410
00:37:20.910 --> 00:37:24.160
I was a part of this... project.

1411
00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:28.830
Thought I was going to be a part of something
special.

1412
00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:34.680
And now?

1413
00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:36.610
Now...

1414
00:37:38.670 --> 00:37:40.430
It turned out to be a mistake,

1415
00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:42.610
like everything else.

1416
00:37:43.690 --> 00:37:46.100
What's the point, right?

1417
00:37:48.530 --> 00:37:50.720
Might as well, just-- you do nothing.

1418
00:37:51.810 --> 00:37:53.350
Might as well do nothing.

1419
00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:57.190
You've brought up this issue before,

1420
00:37:58.220 --> 00:38:00.560
this issue of not feeling like you're in control.

1421
00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:01.610
Do you remember?

1422
00:38:05.410 --> 00:38:06.960
When we spoke about your father.

1423
00:38:08.250 --> 00:38:10.550
You talked about how he chose to do nothing

1424
00:38:10.690 --> 00:38:12.500
when he was battling his cancer.

1425
00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:16.540
You told him he could have fought the company that
caused it.

1426
00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:18.510
He could have told people about it.

1427
00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:21.070
He could have sought better care than what he was
getting.

1428
00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:23.530
Instead, he did nothing.

1429
00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:29.770
Maybe your father felt the same way as you do now.

1430
00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:33.870
After all, like you said, what's the point?

1431
00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:35.630
- It's different. - What's different

1432
00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:39.110
is you've found options, Elliot.

1433
00:38:39.270 --> 00:38:42.510
That's the power you have. That's the control you
own.

1434
00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:45.380
You don't have to just take what life gives you.

1435
00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:48.000
Come on.

1436
00:38:48.650 --> 00:38:51.440
Tell me what is going on with you.

1437
00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:54.070
I cannot help you if you keep me in the dark.

1438
00:38:54.070 --> 00:38:55.100
Shut up!

1439
00:38:58.770 --> 00:39:00.080
Shut up!

1440
00:39:03.250 --> 00:39:04.790
You've got bags under your eyes.

1441
00:39:04.830 --> 00:39:06.780
You're yelling. You're jittery.

1442
00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:08.820
For the last month, I have seen you

1443
00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:11.750
slip into old patterns, old behaviors.

1444
00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:17.010
What is going on?

1445
00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:17.880
He's still not answering.

1446
00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:21.620
Well, we'll just have to ask him tomorrow.

1447
00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:24.380
Every time I try to play it or rip it,

1448
00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:27.900
it just freezes up my computer and spits it back
out again.

1449
00:40:29.170 --> 00:40:30.290
He's not okay.

1450
00:40:31.150 --> 00:40:33.130
He was acting so out of it at work today.

1451
00:40:44.810 --> 00:40:46.230
Are you saying something, babe?

1452
00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:47.470
Something's wrong.

1453
00:40:48.170 --> 00:40:49.440
Should I go over there?

1454
00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:51.450
And just...

1455
00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:53.270
Check in on him?

1456
00:40:54.850 --> 00:40:56.420
Uh...come on.

1457
00:40:57.110 --> 00:40:58.220
That's ridiculous.

1458
00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:00.920
You know he's always been a weirdo, right?

1459
00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:02.680
I'm really worried about him.

1460
00:41:07.830 --> 00:41:10.110
My Arizona buddy Fred hit me up.

1461
00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:12.600
He wants to grab a drink.

1462
00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:14.780
Shouldn't take too long.

1463
00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:17.790
Okay.

1464
00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:33.120
"Deep passions, longing...

1465
00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:35.540
the two of them had never felt such a love,

1466
00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:38.800
such closeness, such a connection."

1467
00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:42.040
Found a way to do it without--

1468
00:42:43.580 --> 00:42:44.420
Sit down.

1469
00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:56.510
I know how to take out the backups

1470
00:42:56.510 --> 00:42:58.040
without blowing up the pipeline.

1471
00:42:58.040 --> 00:42:59.980
You know, Elliot, I really feel like we resolved

1472
00:42:59.980 --> 00:43:02.550
this thing between us. Didn't you walk away?

1473
00:43:02.970 --> 00:43:03.730
I did.

1474
00:43:03.730 --> 00:43:05.430
Didn't I say that if you walked away,

1475
00:43:05.430 --> 00:43:06.900
you were no longer a part of this?

1476
00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.260
I have a real plan--

1477
00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:12.320
If you want me to let you back in,

1478
00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:14.270
there's an understanding we have to come to,

1479
00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:16.240
a debt you have to pay,

1480
00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:18.230
because, remember, you walked away.

1481
00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:19.810
I thought you didn't believe in debts.

1482
00:43:19.810 --> 00:43:22.270
Not true. I believe in debts.

1483
00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:23.810
I believe in erasing them.

1484
00:43:28.590 --> 00:43:29.550
What do you want?

1485
00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:35.310
I want you to tell me about your father.

1486
00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:38.640
You're not gonna get into my head, man.

1487
00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:40.740
Your David Koresh shit isn't gonna work on me.

1488
00:43:40.740 --> 00:43:42.070
Tell me how he died.

1489
00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:44.670
Why, man? Something tells me

1490
00:43:44.670 --> 00:43:46.440
you already looked that shit up anyway.

1491
00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:47.680
I wanna hear it from you.

1492
00:43:55.550 --> 00:43:56.680
So I do this...

1493
00:43:57.780 --> 00:43:59.090
we go back to the arcade,

1494
00:43:59.090 --> 00:44:00.930
discuss the plan with the rest of them?

1495
00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:17.260
I don't know what you want me to say.

1496
00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:20.600
We were close. Very close.

1497
00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:21.900
He was my best friend.

1498
00:44:23.180 --> 00:44:25.070
Worked at Evil Corp his whole life.

1499
00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:28.930
He was one of the best computer engineers they
had.

1500
00:44:30.430 --> 00:44:31.890
And out of the blue, he got fired.

1501
00:44:31.890 --> 00:44:32.980
No one knew why.

1502
00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:35.670
Then one day he told me.

1503
00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:38.630
He had leukemia.

1504
00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:41.750
Made me swear to never tell anyone,

1505
00:44:42.010 --> 00:44:43.200
especially my mom.

1506
00:44:44.690 --> 00:44:45.570
So I didn't.

1507
00:44:46.470 --> 00:44:47.760
A few months go by...

1508
00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:50.030
he got sicker and sicker.

1509
00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:52.920
Finally, I got so worried...

1510
00:44:55.180 --> 00:44:56.170
told my mom.

1511
00:44:57.370 --> 00:44:59.880
When he found out, he got pissed.

1512
00:45:00.670 --> 00:45:01.680
Started yelling.

1513
00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:06.040
I remember I tried to hug him, tell him I'm sorry,
and...

1514
00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:09.350
kept shoving me away and shoved me so hard

1515
00:45:09.650 --> 00:45:11.610
I fell backwards out the window.

1516
00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:13.520
I fell, and I broke my arm.

1517
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:16.560
Never spoke to me after that.

1518
00:45:17.810 --> 00:45:19.100
Couldn't even look at me.

1519
00:45:19.930 --> 00:45:21.240
Even the night he died.

1520
00:45:25.650 --> 00:45:26.480
We good?

1521
00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:44.490
I understand what it's like to lose a parent.

1522
00:45:45.210 --> 00:45:46.130
It's heartbreaking.

1523
00:45:50.270 --> 00:45:51.600
Did you ever think he was right?

1524
00:45:54.340 --> 00:45:55.260
About what?

1525
00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:57.210
Hurting you that day?

1526
00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:00.290
For what you did to him?

1527
00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:02.050
You ever think you deserved it?

1528
00:46:02.910 --> 00:46:04.210
I didn't do anything to him.

1529
00:46:04.210 --> 00:46:05.630
I was trying to help him.

1530
00:46:05.630 --> 00:46:07.100
For betraying his trust.

1531
00:46:08.070 --> 00:46:09.430
I was eight years ol--

1532
00:46:15.250 --> 00:46:17.710
You didn't commit to the sacred pact you'd formed.

1533
00:46:18.305 --> 00:47:18.195
